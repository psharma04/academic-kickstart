If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“**Purchase**”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.

We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected. 

**4.**   **Subscriptions**

Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“**Subscription(s)**”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“**Billing Cycle**”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Heimdall Intranet LTD cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Heimdall Intranet LTD customer support team. 

A valid payment method, including credit card. Patreon, or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Heimdall Intranet LTD with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Heimdall Intranet LTD to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Heimdall Intranet LTD will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

At any time and without notice, Heimdall Intranet LTD reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

**6.**   **Fee Changes**

Heimdall Intranet LTD, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Heimdall Intranet LTD will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
