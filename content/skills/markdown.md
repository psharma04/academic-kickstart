## What is Markdown?

Markdown may be the best thing I've ever learned for being faster at typing. It's essentially a method for formatting structured documents in what's known as "plaintext" (in other words, you can copy-paste it, change fonts, etc.). 

Markdown is amazing because it's completely cross-platform: If I type up a document in Markdown and send it to someone else, they'll view it exactly as I wrote it, but with infinite customisability. Contrast this with something like a [PDF](https://helpx.adobe.com/au/acrobat/using/pdf-x-pdf-a-pdf.html) or [Word](https://fossbytes.com/doc-vs-docx-file-difference-use/) document, which has a billion different styles and standards (What on Earth is "Compatibility Mode" ???), and which will always be in light mode unless you do some technical wizardry (and woe betide those who come across an image).
