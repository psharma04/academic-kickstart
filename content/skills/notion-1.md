## What is Notion?

- Notion is essentially every productivity application, rolled into one.
- Its a mash between Google Docs, Evernote, Trello, and Todoist, covering all of the essentials for organising your life.
- They have a free plan, as well as Personal Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans (Personal Pro is free for students).
- There's apps for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and a website (all of which have near identical functionality).
- The whole platform is structured around the use of blocks, which can be nearly anything.

## How do you use Notion?

- My current setup is split into my personal home, my school stuff, my programming projects, a tracking system for my guitar projects, and the organisational backend for this website. 
- Essentially my whole life gets organised through Notion: 

## How can I set it up for myself?

- You can sign up for free at https://www.notion.so/signup. If you use your school email address, you can upgrade to the Personal Pro plan for free (normally its only 4USD per month, which isn't that much, but free stuff is always nice).
- Everyone studies a bit differently, but Ali Abdaal made a video on how he sets up his Notion workflow for MedSci in university:
