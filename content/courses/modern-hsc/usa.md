## Key Points

### Nature and Impact of Industrialisation

- Industry drove employment and wealth generation throughout the first post-WW1 decade.

### Nature and Impact of Consumerism

- Consumerism emerged as a driver not only in finance, but also in communications, entertainment, dress and behaviour. The development of credit also played a key role.

### Great Depression

- Destroyed the lives of millions of Americans and resulted in Hoover not being re-elected → ultimately resulted in FDR's election and the New Deal

### Racism

- Massive post-war rise in immigration, as well as internal migration of African-Americans, led to the rise of the KKK and future Jim Crow laws

### Rise of Conservatism

- The rise of Conservatism resulted in the prohibition policy, as well as America's isolationist foreign policy

### American Capitalism

- Encouraged the wealthy to exploit and expand in search of profits, driven by the open market and post-war economic booms

## America in the 1920s

- After the first world war, the United states adopted a policy of isolationism and conservatism:

  - Isolationism is the idea that America should not involve itself in the affairs of other countries
  - It came about as a result of over 100 thousand american deaths in WW1
  - Conservatism is the policy of restricting society to traditional values, and opposing innovation or change
  - In the context of post-war America, conservatism came in the form of the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the sale, transport, and production, of alcoholic beverages

- In addition to these policies, big business was given more economic freedom, resulting in a 42% jump in the economy through the decade:

  - The Air Commerce Act resulted in the creation of commercial airlines, allowing former military pilots to become economically productive in a new industry
  - The mass-production of the car by the Ford Motor Company resulted in over 26 million cars registered in America, and 1 billion dollars invested in new roads, bridges, and traffic lights
  - In turn, new gas stations, restaurants, and motels became economically feasible in small towns across the country, as the American Road Trip began to become popular

- Women rapidly gained political and social freedoms:

  - On August 18, 1920, women gained the right to vote in elections through the 19th Amendment
