## Like and Unlike Measurements

- This unit deals with the idea of "like" and "unlike" units, so it's important to understand what these are.
- "Like" measurements are measurements which measure the same thing (e.g. time, distance, mass)
  - For example, grams, kilograms, and tonnes are all like units, because they all measure mass.
  - Seconds, minutes, and hours are like units, because they all measure time.
  - Gallons and Litres are also like units, because they both measure volume.
- Unlike measurements have 2 or more different units involved.
  - Speed, for example, is an unlike measurement, because it's measured in meters (unit of distance) per second (unit of time).
  - Since time can't be converted into a distance, and distance can't be converted into a time, we say that speed is an "unlike measurement".
  - However, comparing the speed of 2 objects is a like measurement, because both measurements will be of speed.

{{< spoiler text="One way to figure out whether 2 measurements are like or unlike is to divide one set's units by the other's (skip this if you don't like algebra)." >}}

- For example, say you have a table of weights versus a table of masses, and you want to figure out if they are like or unlike:
  - The unit for weight is the Newton, which is equal to kilograms times meters per second squared $\left(1N=1kg\cdot m/s^2\right)$.
  - The unit for mass is the kilogram.
  - Eliminating Kilograms from Newtons looks like $\frac{\cancel{kg}\cdot m/s^2}{\cancel{kg}}=m/s^2$.
  - Since all units weren't eliminated, kilograms and newtons are unlike.
- If we try grams and tonnes, however:
  - $1 tonne = 1,000 kg = 1,000,000\color{orange}{g}$
  - $\frac{\cancel{g}}{\cancel{g}}=1,$ therefore tonnes and grams are equivalent units.

## Rates

- A rate is a comparison of 2 unlike quantities.
- Speed is an example of a rate, as it is a comparison of distance (meters or kilometers) with time (seconds or hours)

### Heart Rate

- A person's heart rate is measured by the amount of time it beats each minute.
- Naturally, the unit is Beats per Minute (BPM)
- The resting heart rate for most people is between 60 and 80BPM
- The maximum heart rate (MHR) is different based on age, but can be estimated as 220 minus the person's age in years.
- The Exercise Target Heart Rate is the heart rate you typically aim for when doing exercise, and is between 65% and 85% of that person's MHR.
