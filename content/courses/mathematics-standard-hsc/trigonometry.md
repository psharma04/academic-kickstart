## Trigonometry

### Trigonometric Ratios

- There are 3 (important) trigonometric ratios you need to learn: sine, cosine, and tangent
- These three ratios are based on the angles and side lengths of a right angle triangle

> ![right-angle-triangle](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/psharma04/image-repo@main/uploads/right-angle-triangleTNe85g-20201215194323193PbWkcD.svg)

{{< callout note >}}

Opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse are often abbreviated as O, A, and H.

The angle is usually notated as a greek letter, usually theta $(\theta)$

{{< /callout >}}

- If you have any 2 side lengths, you can calculate the values of all other angles and sides using these ratios
- However, THIS ONLY WORKS FOR RIGHT ANGLED TRIANGLES!!!

The ratios are as follows:

- $sin(angle)=\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$

<br>

- $cos(angle)=\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$

<br>

- $tan(angle)=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}$

<br>

{{< callout note >}}

All three of these functions (sin, cos, tan) are available on most scientific calculators.

To remember the ratios, a common mnemonic (memory device) is SOH CAH TOA:

#### Solving Problems using Trigonometric Ratios

1. Draw the triangle, labelling the angles and sides.

2. Use SOH CAH TOA to decide which formula to use.
3. Rearrange the formula to get the correct subject (whatever the question wants you to find).
4. Substitute and solve.

##### Example Question

> A right angled triangle has hypotenuse=$6.1mm$ and an angle of $30^\circ$. Find the length of the opposite side.

1. Diagram and labelling

2. SOH CAH TOA

> Since we have an angle and the hypotenuse, and we need to find the opposite, sin is the formula to go with.

3. Rearrange

> $\begin{eqnarray}sin(θ)=\frac{O}{H} \\\\ O=H\times\sin(θ)\end{eqnarray}$

4. Solve

> $\begin{eqnarray}a=6.1\times\sin(30^{\circ}) \\\\ =3.05mm \end{eqnarray}$

##### Practice Questions

1. A right angled triangle has opposite of 13.8cm and an angle of $53.8^\circ$. Find the length of the adjacent.
