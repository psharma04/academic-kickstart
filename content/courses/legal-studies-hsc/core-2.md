## The Nature and Development of Rights

### Key Definitions

- Universal: Apply to all people regardless of status, race and gender.
- Inalienable: They cannot be taken away or given up.
- Inherent: People have human rights because they are human beings.
- Indivisible: All people are entitled to all rights and no one is better than another.
- Interdependent: People's enjoyment of one human right is affected by their enjoyment of all others
- Soft law: don’t need to abide (e.g. traditions and precedents)
- Hard law: have to abide 

### Importance of Universal Human Rights

#### Abolition of slavery: 

- Emancipation Act (1833), abolished slavery throughout British :uk: colonies. The motive included humane and liberal principles for anti-slavery
  - Examples: Black market slave trade, Human trafficking, Sex slaves 

- Laws criminalising human trafficking and slavery are contained within Divisions 270 and 271 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 (Criminal Code). 

#### American :us: Civil War

- Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Act 2013 (Slavery Act) 

> Article 4: No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited.

- Abolition of slavery - went against religion. 
- UN office on Drugs and crime → 2.5 million people worldwide are at any given time entrapped, transported, exploited → Australia enacting domestic legislation

### Trade Unionism and Labour Rights

- Under laissez-faire princples, enterprise bargaining wasn't an option. 

- Union meant everyone gets the same. Employers didn't want to lose profits.

- Historically employers were free to **exploit** workers for economic gain.

- **18th century Britain :uk: -** Industrial revolution led to the emergence of unions aiming to protect the rights of workers 

- UDHR: Article 23(1): Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protect against employment 

- Employers were lobbying the government - government listened as employers had money - rise of Labour party

- Work choices - Howard government promised the rights of workers 

- Fair Work Act 2009: Governs the employee/employer relationship in Australia.
  -  Provides safety net of minimum entitlements, enables flexible working hours, fairness at work and prevent discrimination against employees

### Universal Suffrage

- Only universal male suffrage existed- E.g. **NSW Legislative Council 1842** allowed wealthy men to vote 21 & over

- Aboriginal men and women were excluded from voting in Commonwealth elections

- Women’s voting rights for the federal parliament were won in 1902

●   The first jurisdiction was South Australia in 1894 in the **Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act**

- Aboriginal men & women are allowed to vote under the **Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918** when amended in 1962

- In China :cn: , competition is unfair: it’s illegal to make political parties that contest elections against the Communist Party.

- Women were only given the right to vote in Kuwait in 2005, women in Saudi Arabia :saudi_arabia: have the right to vote 2015

- Article 21 - (2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country

### Right to Education

- People of all social classes recognised that education offered a means of ensuring the future for their children. Limited to particular groups and classes based on worth in society.

> UDHR Article 26(1): Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory.

- Domestic: Education is a free compulsory right. Public schools are free to attend for Australian citizens and permanent residents as a result of Government funding. 

- **The Australian Education Act 2013 (Cth):** Government's responsibility to provide funding for government and non government schools. Primary education 'compulsory, available and free to all'. 

- **The New South Wales Education Reform Act 1990:** Education is the primary responsibility of the child’s parents

### Self-Determination

- In the 1990s genocide broke out in Rwanda :ran , and African and Asian countries strived for independence in the 1960s

- Decolonisation led to the development of states that were artificial creations.

- These states were usually determined by colonial power and often cut pre-existing ethnic or cultural boundaries.

[**Case Law: Mabo vs State of Queensland (1992)**](https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/23.html)

Eddie Mabo challenged the Queensland Government's claim that, under the policy of *terra nullius*, Indigenous customary law was not applicable or enforceable.

The High Court ruled that Indigenous law was to be recognised by Australian courts, although existing post-colonial laws took precedence where they conflicted with Aboriginal laws.

This system is called *radical title*, and is one of the three forms of post-colonial custodial recognition:

- **Terra Nullius** is the policy of not recognising indigenous law in the national legal system (e.g. colonial-era Australia:australia: ).
- **Native Title** is the policy of considering indigenous law above federal/state law [(e.g. Indian reservations in the United States :us:)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gr6DpjEmWo).
- **Radical/Alloidal Title** is the policy of considering the current dominant power's laws above indigenous law (e.g. most former British :uk: colonies).

- Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations refers to the "principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples".
- This was confirmed by the UN General Assembly through the Declaration of Friendly Relations (1970)
- The 1954 Geneva Accords ended French occupation of Indochina, resulting in North and South Vietnam :vietnam:

### Environmental Rights

Atmospheric pollution, Depletion of ozone layer, Global warming, Marine pollution, Nuclear pollution 

- NGO’s - Green Army: Provides a six-month programme for 17–24 year olds to train and work in the environment. Community organisations, Landcare groups, environment groups, local councils apply to host a Green Army project.

- Charter of UN (1945) said war was only to be used on authorisation. 

- Non-military "interventions" can take place - Security Council impose ssanctions (interruption of economic relations and other means of communication severing diplomatic relations to deplete countries) → E.g. Sanctions imposed on Iraq :iraq:

- Article 2 → Obligation of states to “respect, implement and promote” key principles for human dignity. 

- AUS: Age Discrimination Act 2004, Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, Disability Discrimination Act 1992

## Formal Statements of Human Rights

- The *Universal Declaration of Human Rights*, *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights*, and *International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights* are the de facto statements on human rights from the UN.
- These 3 documents are based on *international customary laws*, the general consensus by national governments on what should be considered lawful, as well as *international treaties*, agreements which bind the signing nations to certain behaviours.
- Article 1 of the [UN Charter](https://www.un.org/about-us/un-charter/full-text) requires the organisation to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all regardless age, sex, language or religion.
- Article 55 states the UN shall promote respect for and observance of human rights.

### Major Human Rights Documents and their Contributions

#### Soft Law - UDHR

- The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was developed as a response to the unprecedented barbarity of World War II.
- It declares the promotion of universal respect, the observance of fundamental rights, and the inherent dignity of a human.
- There are 30 articles, covering different areas of human rights.
  - For example, article 1 asserts the right of all people to freedom, equality, and dignity.
  - Article 2 prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, language, religion,  sexuality, orientation, etc.
  - Articles 3-12 outline civil and political rights, such as the right to participate in government, the right to life, liberty, and freedom, the right to a fair trial, etc.
  - Articles 22-27 detail economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to work and unionise.

{{< callout info >}}

Modern History students may recognise some of these phrases from Woodrow Wilson's 14 Point Plan.

{{< /callout >}}

- **It is important to note that the UDHR is not legally binding.** This (and most UN documents) serve as a guideline, or recommendation, for governments to base their policies on.

#### Hard Law - ICCPR

- The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is designed to protect people from the actions of oppressive governments.
- The covenant was adopted in 1966, and hase been in force since 1976.
- The document protects individuals from arbitrary and totalitarian exercises of power by the state, in accordance with the freedoms provided by the UDHR.
- Despite 173 countries being party to the covenant, the rights outlined by it are broken often.

#### Hard Law - ICESCR

- The international Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural rights recognises that national and global resources are finite.
- Article 2 requires all states to take steps, through international economic and technical cooperation and assistance , towards achieving ‘progressively the full realisation of the rights recognised in the present convention’
- The convention also asserts non-discrimination, stated in much the same terms as the UDHR
- It places responsibilities on all individuals to strive to promote and achieve these rights 
- Key features include: Equal rights for men and women (article 3), Right to social security (article 9), Right to the highest standard of physical and mental health (article)
- All states parties are required to report on the measures adopted to being about the fulfillment of these rights

## Promoting and Enforcing Human Rights

### State Sovereignty

- The authority of a nation state to govern itself without international interference. 

> [“The UN is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members.”](https://legal.un.org/repertory/art2.shtml)

#### The UN Charter

- International enforcement of human rights seems to undermine state sovereignty, involves international interference in domestic affairs.
- Balance must be achieved between respecting state sovereignty and ensuring human 
  rights standards are adhered to.
- [Responsibility to Protect](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/about-responsibility-to-protect.shtml) is an emerging philosophy and UNSC framework that sovereignty is secondary to protecting the rights of individuals.

### The United Nations

- Just like many countries, the UN is separated into a legislative, judicial, and executive branch.

#### UN General Assembly

- Composed of 1 representative from each member state (similar to a legislative branch), and is the primary UN forum for discussing civil rights issues.
- Contains various subsidiary bodies, such as the UN Human rights council.

#### UN Security Council

- Maintains international peace and security.
- Can pass legally binding resolutions on Member states (e.g. sanctions).
- Approve military intervention or political sanctions to protect human rights and 
  encourage compliance with human rights standards.
- Five permanent members (China, USA, UK, Russia and France), which are accompanied by [10 members](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/current-members) who are elected for a two year term by the General Assembly.

#### International Court of Justice

- Judicial component of the UN.
- Judges international civil disputes, and advises on human rights law.
- Works in conjunction with the International Criminal Court to prosecute crimes against humanity.
- Can be considered the civil component of the international judicial system (ICC would be the criminal component).

#### Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights

- Established in 1993 to oversee the Human Rights Council
- Offers support and expertise to human rights agencies and monitoring bodies.
- Conducts the [Universal Periodic Review](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/upr/pages/uprmain.aspx) of international compliance with the ICCPR and ICESCR.

#### Human Rights Council
- Subsidiary of the General Assembly
- Responsible for the international promotion of human rights
- Makes recommendations to the UNGA and UNSC regarding human rights crises

#### Other Intergovernmental Organisations
- European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Commonwealth of Nations.

### Courts and Tribunals

#### International Criminal Court

- Prosecutes international criminals
- Supersedes the temporary tribunals that previously performed this task (e.g. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda)

#### International Court of Justice

- Provides advisory opinions to the UNGA regarding international law
- Jurisdiction is limited, preventing effective enforcements.
- Additionally, the ICJ is unable to hear private human rights complaints.

#### Statutory Authorities

-   Treaty bodies which **monitor compliance with major human rights treaties**
- Consider individual complaints and reports where required
- Publish opinions and suggestions on treaty compliance
- Organise forums on relevant themes
- Decisions not enforceable but highly influential
- **Examples:**
  - Human Rights Committee: Assesses compliance with international bills of rights
  - Committee on the Rights of the Child
  - Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
  - Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

#### Non-Government Organisations

- Operate independently of governments
- Has become increasingly common as the concept of fundamental rights develops
- Examples include the Red Cross and Amnesty International

#### Media

- Raises public awareness of human rights responsibilities and abuses
- Rallies public and government action similarly to NGO’s
- Increasing role of media ensures full coverage of human rights issues

## Human Rights in Australian Law

- The sign-ratify-enforce process incorporates international law into a dualist legal system
- Commonwealth will pass laws reflective of signed treaties and enforce them in the country
- **Examples:**
  - Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women: Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth).
  - Rome Statute: International Criminal Court Act 2002 (Cth).

## Effectiveness of Australian Responses to Human Rights issues

### The Constitution

- Divides powers between state and federal governments
- Grants external affairs power to Commonwealth (s 51)
- Treaty obligations are imposed on all state jurisdictions
- Allows federal legislative protection of Human Rights

-   Separates Westminster system of government into arms of judiciary, executive and legislative
- Checks and balances system acts as safeguard against abuses of power which could jeopardize individual rights
- Judiciary investigates validity of legislation in terms of human rights and constitutional obligations

##### Express and Implied Rights

- Freedom of Religion
- Freedom to Vote
- Right to Trial by Jury
- Freedom of Political Communication

##### Common Law

- Develops independent of legislature, provides socially realistic approach to human rights breaches
- Brings to light new legal concerns to do with inadequacies in Australian human rights legislation
- Fails to provide real, concrete protection of individual freedom

##### Statutory Law

- Main protection of human rights in Australia
- Most enforceable and wide reaching
- Examples:
  - Racial Discrimination Act 1975
  - Sex Discrimination Act 1984
  - AHRC Act 1986

#### ### Courts and Tribunals

#### Australian Human Rights Commission

- Receives and investigates human rights complaints

- Promotes awareness of domestic and international human rights issues
- Submits reports to parliament concerning improvement of HR standards
- Plays role in the ‘Charter of Rights’ debate

#### High Court of Australia

- Landmark HR cases include the Toonen Case, and the Mabo Case

## Arguments for and against an Australian Charter of Rights

| For                                                          | Against                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Extremely high community support                             | Current HR protection is considered adequate                 |
| Re-addressing the inadequacy of existing human rights protections | Undermines the tradition of parliamentary sovereignty, instead transferring legislative power to unelected judges (violates Separation of Powers) |
| Reflects basic national values                               | No guarantee of better protections                           |
| Improves the quality and accountability of government        | Excessive and costly litigation                              |
| Contributes to a culture of respect for human rights         | Arguments that democratic institutions offer better protections |
| Improves international standing                              | High short-term economic cost                                |
| Brings Australia into line with other democracies            | Unnecessarily legalisation - most things are enforced through OHS/statutory law. |
| Produces economic benefits                                   |                                                              |
