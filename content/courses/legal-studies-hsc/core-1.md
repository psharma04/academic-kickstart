## The Nature of Crime

- A crime is an act (or lack of an act) against the community, punishable by a recognised criminal sanction **upon proof of guilt in a criminal proceeding**.
- Many crimes are dependent on the jurisdiction and society they occur within, depending on cultural values and beliefs.
  - For example, many countries still ban homosexuality (punishable by death in some countries[^1]), while others have specific legal protections regarding discrimination against LGBT people.
- Criminal justice systems serve to redress an injustice against both individuals and the community, based on shared values.
- Crimes tend to fall under one of 3 categories:
  - Voluntary Acts are acts which were performed without the requirement of external pressures (e.g. punching someone).
  - Involuntary Acts are acts which were performed unintentionally.
  - Omissory Acts (also known as Acts of Omission or Omissions of Duty) are where an act was expected or required to be performed, but was not (e.g. a missed safety inspection)

### The Elements of a Crime

- The prosecution must demonstrate and prove guilt **beyond a reasonable doubt** (standard of proof) for an indictable offence.
- The term "onus of proof" refers to the fact that the prosecution is responsible for proving guilt, and that the defendant (person who was accused) has no obligation to demonstrate their own guilt. In other words, the burden of proof is on the prosecution.

#### Actus Reus

- Latin for "guilty act".
- Refers to the physical action of commiting a crime. 
- This is often the easiest part to prove (CCTV, witness testimony, and physical evidence can easily be used).

#### Mens Rea

- Latin for "guilty mind".
- Must prove any of the following:
  - Full intention
  - Full Knowledge
  - Recklessness
  - Criminal Negligence

{{< spoiler text="What do these terms mean? Click here to find out." >}}

- **Full Intention** just means that a person planned to engage in that action, or would have expected to engage in that action should that situation arise.
  - For example, a person breaks into someone's house while the resident is away over Christmas. The person is considered to have full intention, because they would have likely scouted the house beforehand, and/or known that the residents would be away. Therefore, the person must have had an intention to break into the house.
- **Full Knowledge** is where a person was aware that an event would occur.
  - For example, a person arms a time bomb in a public place, but the bomb is defused by police before it explodes. However, that person knew that, in the "ordinary" or "expected" course of events, their actions would cause harm in the future. The fact that the bomb was defused is not defensible, because the intention of the person was arming a bomb **knowing that it would cause harm**.
- **Recklessness** is where a person is aware of a substantial risk in performing an action, but chooses to take that action anyway.
  - For example, driving while under the influence of alcohol is known to be a highly risky action, so someone who is driving drunk and hits someone is likely to have their actions considered reckless.
- **Criminal Negligence** is where a person neglects to fulfil their obligations (i.e. duty of care), resulting in harm to someone else.
  - For example, a parent leaves their child in a closed car. The child dies of heatstroke. The parent is considered to have been negligent, because they failed to fulfil their duty of care to the child by leaving them in a dangerous situation.
- Full intention is usually considered the "worst" type of intent, in that you are more likely to recieve a longer sentence if full intention is proven. Negligence is usually the shortest sentencing. However, full intention and full knowledge are often the most difficult to prove, as you usually need a close relationship or direct confession, while negligence and recklessness can often be proven by the nature of the action itself.

**R v Thomas Sam v Manju Sam (2009, NSW Supreme Court)**

- The victim (a nine month old girl) passed away, after her parents failed to provide conventional medical treatment for her serious eczema

- The court found that the risks related to the young girl’s condition would have been obvious to any reasonable person, and that as educated adults, her parents should have recognised these risks and sought medical treatment
- Because they failed to do so, the parents were found guilty of manslaughter and imprisoned
- **This is an example of ‘criminal negligence.’**

> Topical example? In my post? Never /s

##### Causation

- The prosecution is responsible for demonstrating that the accused's actions caused the offence or harm (this is part of Actus Reus).

##### Strict Liability Offences

- Reserved for less serious crimes, resulting in no required court attendance.
- Mens rea is not requires, only actus reus (SLO's only occur for crimes where you are "caught in the act").
- Examples include traffic/road offences and graffiti.
- Sometimes there is a court defense if the defendant can prove that the act was an "honest and reasonable mistake".
- Advantages include that they are easy to enforce (e.g. on-the-spot fines), and are equal for everyone.
- Disadvantage is that because the cost is consistent (typically only a fine), they disproportionately harm lower-income people.

**Case Study: R v Munter (2009)**

- The accused, Todd Munter, punched and kicked a 66 year old victim, following a dispute over water restrictions.

- The victim later died of a heart attack as a direct result of the blows inflicted by the accused.
- The accused was convicted of manslaughter and imprisoned.
- **Causation can be established due to the link between the assault and the death of the victim.**
