## Geographic Context

- Located around the Bay of Naples, a crescent-shaped harbour from Misenum to Sorrento.
- Pompeii overlooked the River Sarnus, and was located south of Mt Vesuvius on a volcanic plateau.
- Herculaneum was approximately 7km west of Vesuvius.
- The mountain itself is approximately 1300m tall, and is still active today.
- The surrounding region experiences hot, dry summers, with milder winters.
- Fertile land (on account of the volcano) made the region ideal for agriculture.

### Natural Features

- Access to sea via the Bay of Naples made both cities extremely accessible for trade and communication.
- Both were defensible as they backed onto mountain ranges
- However, the volcanic output from Vesuvius led some to believe that it was the entrance to the Underworld.

#### Natural Resources

| *Resource*           | *Evidence*                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Olive Oil            | Pliny the Elder “nowhere do olives produce more oil”“a  region blessed by fortune”Olive presses were abundant/commonplace: found in houses, villas and in fields. |
| Perfume              | Basic ingredient was olive oil- olive flowers.Florus “spring comes with its flowers twice a year” |
| Wine                 | Used for trade, celebration: known for its potency.Pliny the Elder “Pompeian wines are rather dangerous”“cause a headache” |
| Fishing              | Garum was Pompeii’s signature strongly flavoured fish  sauce. It was traded.Pliny the Elder “famed beyond any other for their  shellfish and fine fish” |
| Wool and Textiles    | Booming industry - regional centre for crop marking and  dyeing. A building provided by the priestess of Eumachia was the HQ of  “Collegium of Fullones” and there was many “fullonicae” scattered around the town.Seneca mentions that a flock of 600 sheep were killed by the  earthquake of 62 AD. |
| Fruit and Vegetables | Fruit and veg were central to the economy. Soil was  suited to cabbage and onion.Archaeological evidence of market gardens  has been found north of the ampitheatre. |
