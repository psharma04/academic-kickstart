## Introduction

- All life on Earth is based on compounds of Carbon, usually in an aqueous environment
- When scientist refer to "organic compounds", it usually means compounds of carbon (excluding simpler compounds like $\ce{CO2,CO,CS2,}etc.\newcommand{degC}{^{\circ}C}\newcommand{deg}{^{\circ}}$)
- Because Carbon is the first element with 4 valence electrons, it can easily covalently bond with many other atoms at once, meaning it can form lots of different compounds
- In module 1, the concept of [Carbon allotropes, molecules of Carbon with have different chemical properties,](/courses/chemistry-prelim/module-1/) was explored
- Module 7 looks at carbon compounds involving other elements (mostly Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and More Carbon™)
- Just as Modules 5 and 6 were basically harder versions of module 2, this is basically the next level of module 1, with a bit of modules 3 and 4 sprinkled in. If you need to revise these, [check out our Preliminary Chemistry Course](/courses/chemistry-prelim/).

## Structure of an Organic Molecule

- Organic molecules have 3 main components:
  - The Backbone: the longest continuous chain of connected carbon molecules in the molecule
  - The Functional Group: an offshoot from the backbone which gives the molecule distinct properties, also known as side groups
  - The Hydrogens: Hydrogen is used to fill all of the leftover Carbon valence electrons

## Types of Organic Carbon Molecules

- Organic carbon compounds fall into two main categories: cyclic and acyclic (also known as closed and open chain). Each type has subcategories within themselves, but for the main categories, seeing an example Lewis diagram of each type gives away where the name comes from:

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Octane_Lewis.svg" theme="light" caption="Octane, an organic acyclic/open-chain compound (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>)." >}}

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Benzene_Structural_diagram.svg" theme="light" caption="Benzene, an organic cyclic/closed-chain compound (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>). Yes I know they should be capital C's, I'll fix that eventually." >}}

- For now, we'll just look at chains, but don't worry, it's still going to hurt your brain.

### Types of Organic Chains

#### Single Bonds (Alkanes)

- Alkanes are organic carbon molecules where Carbon atoms in the backbone are only connected via single bonds
- Alkanes have the general form of $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n+2}}$, and are therefore a homologous series

| Name    | Molecular Formula | Melting Point $(\degC)$ | Boiling Point $(\degC)$ |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| methane | $\ce{CH4}$        | -182                    | -164                    |
| ehtane  | $\ce{C2H6}$       | -183                    | -84                     |
| propane | $\ce{C3H8}$       | -190                    | -42                     |
| butane  | $\ce{C4H10}$      | -138                    | 0                       |
| pentane | $\ce{C5H12}$      | -130                    | 36                      |
| hexane  | $\ce{C6H14}$      | -95                     | 69                      |
| heptane | $\ce{C7H16}$      | -91                     | 98                      |
| octane  | $\ce{C8H18}$      | -57                     | 128                     |



- Alkanes are known as "saturated compounds", and have an open, chain-like structure
- The names will end in -ane, for example, Ethane:
{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Ethan_Lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

#### Branched Alkanes

- Branched alkanes are alkane compounts with Alkyl side groups:

| Alkyl Group | Molecular Formula |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Methyl      | $\ce{CH3-}$       |
| Ethyl       | $\ce{C2H5-}$      |
| Propyl      | $\ce{C3H7-}$      |
| Butyl       | $\ce{C4H9-}$      |
| Pentyl      | $\ce{C5H11-}$     |

{{< callout info >}}

Remembering the names is difficult sometimes, but you might have noticed that they actually correspond to the number of Carbon atoms there are in the skeleton:

| Longest Chain | Prefix | Number of identical groups | Prefix |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 1             | Meth-  | 5                          | Pent-  |
| 2             | Eth-   | 6                          | Hex-   |
| 3             | Prop-  | 7                          | Hept-  |
| 4             | But-   | 8                          | Oct-   |

We'll look at naming organic compounds later on. Remember that you can always jump around the post as needed.

#### Naming Branched Chain Alkanes

1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon, and assign the parent name based on this number

2. Find whatever groups that are not part of the longest continuous chain. Name these as **prefixes** and put

   them in **alphabetical order**.

3. Assign numbers to groups by counting from the closest end of the chain

##### Example

{{< figure src="https://images.schoolnotes.xyz/uploads/3-methylhexane_lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

- There are 6 carbons in the main chain, with the largest bond being a single bond, so the ending is -hexane
- The side chain has 1 carbon and 3 hydrogen, so methyl- is added (methylhexane)
- The side chain is at position 3, so the compound is 3-methylhexane

##### This system works for all 3 types of open-chain organic molecules, just switch out -ane for the correct ending.

#### Double Bonds (Alkenes)

- Alkenes are organic compounds where the Backbone carbon has double bonds
- Alkenes can also have single bonds in the backbone, but there must be at least 1 double bond (BUT NO TRIPLE BONDS!!!)
- Alkenes are known as "unsaturated compounds", and are more reactive than alkanes as a result of the double bond
- The names of alkenes end with -ene, for example 1-pentene:
{{< figure src="/uploads/1-pentene_lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

#### Variants of Alkenes

- The location of double bonds can be different, even if the empirical formula is the same
- For example, Butanol has 2 variants:

{{< figure src="https://cln.sh/ODbNq1dO9CzOuvwMKUUE+" theme="light" >}}

#### Triple Bonds (Alkynes)

- Alkynes are the last variant of open-chain compounds, and have at least one triple bond in their backbone
- Alkynes can also have single and double bonds in the backbone, but must have at least 1 triple bond
- Alkynes are also "unsaturated compounds", and are the most reactive organic group
- The names of alkynes ends with -yne, for example propyne:

{{< figure src="https://images.schoolnotes.xyz/uploads/propyne_lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

{{< callout info >}}

INTRODUCING THE SHORTCUT! If you didn't notice the pattern, look at the letter which is different between the three. It goes in alphabetical order! Single bond has A, double bond has E, triple bond has Y.

## Physical Properties

### Properties of Homologous Series

Members of the same homologous series have:

- A **similar structure** and the same general formula and functional group (each member of a homologous series differs by a −𝐶𝐻2 − unit from the previous member)
- A pattern to their physical properties
- Similar chemical properties

### Melting Points and Boiling Points

1. The **melting** and **boiling points** are measures of the thermal energy **required to overcome intermolecular forces**.

2. > As ↑ intermolecular forces, ↑ $E_{Heat},\therefore$↑ MP and ↑ BP

3. The **packing** of molecules also affects the boiling and melting point.

4. - Packing depends on molecular shape. Molecules that are **small, symmetrical** or **unbranched** tend to be able to pack more closely together. This results in **stronger intermolecular forces**.
   - The effect of packing on intermolecular forces strength is more significant for molecules in **solid states** (melting point).

#### Melting Points and Boiling Points of Alkanes

1. Alkane molecules are **nonpolar,** the only intermolecular force is **dispersion forces**. As the length of the carbon chain increases, the overall force of attraction between molecules also increase. (Dispersion forces is proportional to molar mass). Because boiling and point is determined by the strength of intermolecular forces, boiling point increases as alkane chain length increases.

   **Molecular shapes** also influence the strength of dispersion forces. **Straight-chained** alkanes are able to fit together more closely and tend to have higher boiling points than their corresponding chain isomers.

   Melting point is affected by the strength of the dispersion forces, size and shape of the molecule.

   Melting points of hydrocarbons follow the same general patterns as boiling points, with a few exceptions. The melting points of straight-chain hydrocarbons increase as the number of carbon increases. However, there are **deviations** in this trend, relating to whether the molecules have an **even or odd** number of **carbon atoms**.

   Chains with **even numbers** of carbon atoms pack **slightly more efficiently** in the solid state than chains with **odd numbers**. The more efficient packing requires more energy to melt the compound resulting in a higher melting point.

| Name    | Molecular Mass | Melting Point | Boiling Point |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Methane | 16.04          | -182          | -164          |
| Ethane  | 30.07          | -183          | -89           |
| Propane | 44.09          | -190          | -42           |
| Butane  | 58.12          | -138          | 0             |
| Pentane | 72.15          | -130          | 36            |
| Hexane  | 86.17          | -95           | 69            |
| Heptane | 100.2          | -91           | 98            |
| Octane  | 114.2          | -57           | 126           |

> That took longer than it should have, all because we wanted a scaleable graph. Is that too much to ask, internet?

### Melting Points and Boiling Points of Alkenes and Alkynes

- Alkenes and alkynes, like alkanes, are **nonpolar hydrocarbons.** 
- Their molecules are also nonpolar so the forces of attraction between them are only weak dispersion forces. 
- Members of these homologous series have relatively low boiling points similar to those observed for alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms.

- As with alkanes, the boiling points of alkenes and alkynes increase with molecular size as the strength of dispersion forces between molecules increase.

- The boiling points of alkenes are slightly lower than alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms.
- Alkynes have higher boiling points than both alkenes and alkanes that have the same number of carbon atoms. This is due to the increase packing because of its linear shape.

- Since alkenes have lower molecular mass compared to alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, the strength of the dispersion forces is weaker. Hence the boiling points are lower.

- Alkenes, alkynes and haloalkanes follow the similar pattern to alkanes. 
- As the length of the carbon chain increases, the melting point increases. 
- The alkenes **ethene, propene** and **butene** are all gases at room temperature, alkenes with 5-14 carbons are liquid, and longer-chained molecules are solid.
- Alkynes follow the same general trend for melting points seen in alkanes and alkenes. 
- However, the **position of the triple bond** can greatly affect the melting points as the shape of the molecule changes.

### Solubility

- The solubility of a substance depends on the **strength** of the **InterMolecular Forces within the solute** and **within the solvent** (cohesive forces), in comparison to the **IMF** between the solute and solvent (adhesive forces).

- The generalisation is that **polar compounds** tend to only dissolve well in **polar compounds** and **non-polar** compounds only dissolve in **non-polar compounds**.

- Hydrocarbons are soluble in each other as well as in non-polar organic compounds such as benzene, diethyl ether and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane). 
- This is because the **cohesive forces** within the solvent are also **weak dispersion forces** that are **similar in strength to the dispersion forces within hydrocarbons**.

### Density

- Density is the measure of mass per unit volume ${g/mL\text{ or }g/cm^{3}}$

| Alkane      | Formula       | Density $(g/cm^{3}\text{ at }20\degC)$ | Molecular Mass $(g/mol)$ |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pentane     | $\ce{C5H12}$  | 0.626                                  | 72.15                    |
| Decane      | $\ce{C10H22}$ | 0.730                                  | 142.3                    |
| Pentadecane | $\ce{C15H32}$ | 0.768                                  | 212.4                    |
| Isosane     | $\ce{C20H42}$ | 0.789                                  | 282.6                    |

- Alkanes cannot mix with water → If you try, the alkane will float on top of the water
- This is because all alkanes have a lower density than water

### Volatility

Volatility is the **ability of a liquid** (or solid) **to escape and form a vapour**. ↑ BP→↑ IMF Strength→↑ Volatility Volatility is measured by **vapour pressure**, which is a measure of concentration in the gas phase above the liquid. It is **constant** at a **constant temperature**.

Hydrocarbons are **non-polar** and hence have **dispersion forces** as their only **intermolecular force**. Since the intermolecular forces are **relatively weak**, their **bonds are easily overcome** and hence the **BP is relatively low**. Therefore, hydrocarbons will be volatile.

> ↑ Molecular Mass → ↑ Strength of dispersion forces → ↑ 𝐸h𝑒𝑎𝑡 → ↓ Volatility at a constant temperature.

### Viscosity

Viscosity refers to a substance’s **resistance to fluid flow.** Liquids with a relatively high resistance to flow have high viscosity. For a substance to flow, particles must flow over each other. Viscosity depends on:

- Strength of intermolecular forces. ↑ IMF→↑ Viscosity

- Size of molecules. ↑ Size→↑ Viscosity

- Temperature. ↑ Temperature→↓ Viscosity

  Viscosity decreases with **increasing temperature**. At higher temperatures, molecules have **greater kinetic energy**. Thus, the molecules move around more which increases the space between molecules. This causes the **intermolecular forces** to be **weaker** and **hence viscosity decreases**.

## Functional Groups

A functional group is an **atom or group of atoms** which give a compound **some characteristic physical** and **chemical property**.

A homologous **series** is a family of organic compounds with the **same general formula** or **functional groups** with **similar chemical properties**.

### Alcohols (Alkanols)

Alcohols are formed when one of the hydrogens on the end of the chain has been replaced with an -OH group

#### Naming

1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon that contains the functional group
2. Replace the ane/ene/yne with -ol
3. Name the substituents as prefixes in alphabetical order
4. Number the chain so that the functional group has the lowest possible number

Alcohols can also be classified according to the number of carbon atoms attached to the carbon bearing the -OH group.

- A **primary** (1°) alcohol is one in which the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to **one** other carbon atom.
- A **secondary** (2°) alcohol is one in which the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to **two** other carbon atoms.
- A **tertiary** (3°) alcohol is one in which the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to **three** other carbon atoms.
