## Introduction

- All life on Earth is based on compounds of Carbon, usually in an aqueous environment
- When scientist refer to "organic compounds", it usually means compounds of carbon (excluding simpler compounds like $\ce{CO2,CO,CS2,}etc.\newcommand{degC}{^{\circ}C}\newcommand{deg}{^{\circ}}$)
- Because Carbon is the first element with 4 valence electrons, it can easily covalently bond with many other atoms at once, meaning it can form lots of different compounds
- In module 1, the concept of [Carbon allotropes, molecules of Carbon with have different chemical properties,](/courses/chemistry-prelim/module-1/) was explored
- Module 7 looks at carbon compounds involving other elements (mostly Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and More Carbon™)
- Just as Modules 5 and 6 were basically harder versions of module 2, this is basically the next level of module 1, with a bit of modules 3 and 4 sprinkled in. If you need to revise these, [check out our Preliminary Chemistry Course](/courses/chemistry-prelim/).

## Structure of an Organic Molecule

- Organic molecules have 3 main components:
  - The Backbone: the longest continuous chain of connected carbon molecules in the molecule
  - The Functional Group: an offshoot from the backbone which gives the molecule distinct properties, also known as side groups
  - The Hydrogens: Hydrogen is used to fill all of the leftover Carbon valence electrons

## Types of Organic Carbon Molecules

- Organic carbon compounds fall into two main categories: cyclic and acyclic (also known as closed and open chain). Each type has subcategories within themselves, but for the main categories, seeing an example Lewis diagram of each type gives away where the name comes from:

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Octane_Lewis.svg" theme="light" caption="Octane, an organic acyclic/open-chain compound (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>)." >}}

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Benzene_Structural_diagram.svg" theme="light" caption="Benzene, an organic cyclic/closed-chain compound (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>). Yes I know they should be capital C's, I'll fix that eventually." >}}

- For now, we'll just look at chains, but don't worry, it's still going to hurt your brain.

### Types of Organic Chains

#### Single Bonds (Alkanes)

- Alkanes are organic carbon molecules where Carbon atoms in the backbone are only connected via single bonds
- Alkanes have the general form of $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n+2}}$, and are therefore a homologous series

| Name    | Molecular Formula | Melting Point $(\degC)$ | Boiling Point $(\degC)$ |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| methane | $\ce{CH4}$        | -182                    | -164                    |
| ehtane  | $\ce{C2H6}$       | -183                    | -84                     |
| propane | $\ce{C3H8}$       | -190                    | -42                     |
| butane  | $\ce{C4H10}$      | -138                    | 0                       |
| pentane | $\ce{C5H12}$      | -130                    | 36                      |
| hexane  | $\ce{C6H14}$      | -95                     | 69                      |
| heptane | $\ce{C7H16}$      | -91                     | 98                      |
| octane  | $\ce{C8H18}$      | -57                     | 128                     |



- Alkanes are known as "saturated compounds", and have an open, chain-like structure
- The names will end in -ane, for example, Ethane:
{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Ethan_Lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

#### Branched Alkanes

- Branched alkanes are alkane compounts with Alkyl side groups:

| Alkyl Group | Molecular Formula |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Methyl      | $\ce{CH3-}$       |
| Ethyl       | $\ce{C2H5-}$      |
| Propyl      | $\ce{C3H7-}$      |
| Butyl       | $\ce{C4H9-}$      |
| Pentyl      | $\ce{C5H11-}$     |

{{< callout info >}}

Remembering the names is difficult sometimes, but you might have noticed that they actually correspond to the number of Carbon atoms there are in the skeleton:

| Longest Chain | Prefix | Number of identical groups | Prefix |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 1             | Meth-  | 5                          | Pent-  |
| 2             | Eth-   | 6                          | Hex-   |
| 3             | Prop-  | 7                          | Hept-  |
| 4             | But-   | 8                          | Oct-   |

We'll look at naming organic compounds later on. Remember that you can always jump around the post as needed.

#### Naming Branched Chain Alkanes

1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon, and assign the parent name based on this number

2. Find whatever groups that are not part of the longest continuous chain. Name these as **prefixes** and put

   them in **alphabetical order**.

3. Assign numbers to groups by counting from the closest end of the chain

##### Example

{{< figure src="https://images.schoolnotes.xyz/uploads/3-methylhexane_lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

- There are 6 carbons in the main chain, with the largest bond being a single bond, so the ending is -hexane
- The side chain has 1 carbon and 3 hydrogen, so methyl- is added (methylhexane)
- The side chain is at position 3, so the compound is 3-methylhexane

##### This system works for all 3 types of open-chain organic molecules, just switch out -ane for the correct ending.

#### Double Bonds (Alkenes)

- Alkenes are organic compounds where the Backbone carbon has double bonds
- Alkenes can also have single bonds in the backbone, but there must be at least 1 double bond (BUT NO TRIPLE BONDS!!!)
- Alkenes are known as "unsaturated compounds", and are more reactive than alkanes as a result of the double bond
- The names of alkenes end with -ene, for example 1-pentene:
{{< figure src="/uploads/1-pentene_lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

#### Variants of Alkenes

- The location of double bonds can be different, even if the empirical formula is the same
- For example, Butanol has 2 variants:

{{< figure src="https://cln.sh/ODbNq1dO9CzOuvwMKUUE+" theme="light" >}}

#### Triple Bonds (Alkynes)

- Alkynes are the last variant of open-chain compounds, and have at least one triple bond in their backbone
- Alkynes can also have single and double bonds in the backbone, but must have at least 1 triple bond
- Alkynes are also "unsaturated compounds", and are the most reactive organic group
- The names of alkynes ends with -yne, for example propyne:

{{< figure src="https://images.schoolnotes.xyz/uploads/propyne_lewis.svg" theme="light" >}}

{{< callout info >}}

INTRODUCING THE SHORTCUT! If you didn't notice the pattern, look at the letter which is different between the three. It goes in alphabetical order! Single bond has A, double bond has E, triple bond has Y.

## Physical Properties

### Properties of Homologous Series

Members of the same homologous series have:

- A **similar structure** and the same general formula and functional group (each member of a homologous series differs by a −𝐶𝐻2 − unit from the previous member)
- A pattern to their physical properties
- Similar chemical properties

### Melting Points and Boiling Points

- The **melting** and **boiling points** are measures of the thermal energy **required to overcome intermolecular forces**. 

> As ↑ intermolecular forces, ↑ $E_{Heat},\therefore$↑ MP and ↑ BP

- The **packing** of molecules also affects the boiling and melting point.Packing depends on molecular shape. Molecules that are **small, symmetrical** or **unbranched** tend to be able to pack more closely together. This results in **stronger intermolecular forces**.

- The effect of packing on intermolecular forces strength is more significant for molecules in **solid states** (melting point).

#### Melting Points and Boiling Points of Alkanes

Alkane molecules are **nonpolar,** the only intermolecular force is **dispersion forces**. As the length of the carbon chain increases, the overall force of attraction between molecules also increase. (Dispersion forces is proportional to molar mass). Because boiling and point is determined by the strength of intermolecular forces, boiling point increases as alkane chain length increases.

**Molecular shapes** also influence the strength of dispersion forces. **Straight-chained** alkanes are able to fit together more closely and tend to have higher boiling points than their corresponding chain isomers.

Melting point is affected by the strength of the dispersion forces, size and shape of the molecule.

Melting points of hydrocarbons follow the same general patterns as boiling points, with a few exceptions. The melting points of straight-chain hydrocarbons increase as the number of carbon increases. However, there are **deviations** in this trend, relating to whether the molecules have an **even or odd** number of **carbon atoms**.

Chains with **even numbers** of carbon atoms pack **slightly more efficiently** in the solid state than chains with **odd numbers**. The more efficient packing requires more energy to melt the compound resulting in a higher melting point.

| Name    | Molecular Mass | Melting Point | Boiling Point |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Methane | 16.04          | -182          | -164          |
| Ethane  | 30.07          | -183          | -89           |
| Propane | 44.09          | -190          | -42           |
| Butane  | 58.12          | -138          | 0             |
| Pentane | 72.15          | -130          | 36            |
| Hexane  | 86.17          | -95           | 69            |
| Heptane | 100.2          | -91           | 98            |
| Octane  | 114.2          | -57           | 126           |

> That took longer than it should have, all because we wanted a scaleable graph. Is that too much to ask, internet?

### Melting Points and Boiling Points of Alkenes and Alkynes

- Alkenes and alkynes, like alkanes, are **nonpolar hydrocarbons.** 
- Their molecules are also nonpolar so the forces of attraction between them are only weak dispersion forces. 
- Members of these homologous series have relatively low boiling points similar to those observed for alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms.

- As with alkanes, the boiling points of alkenes and alkynes increase with molecular size as the strength of dispersion forces between molecules increase.

- The boiling points of alkenes are slightly lower than alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms.
- Alkynes have higher boiling points than both alkenes and alkanes that have the same number of carbon atoms. This is due to the increase packing because of its linear shape.

- Since alkenes have lower molecular mass compared to alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, the strength of the dispersion forces is weaker. Hence the boiling points are lower.

- Alkenes, alkynes and haloalkanes follow the similar pattern to alkanes. 
- As the length of the carbon chain increases, the melting point increases. 
- The alkenes **ethene, propene** and **butene** are all gases at room temperature, alkenes with 5-14 carbons are liquid, and longer-chained molecules are solid.
- Alkynes follow the same general trend for melting points seen in alkanes and alkenes. 
- However, the **position of the triple bond** can greatly affect the melting points as the shape of the molecule changes.

### Solubility

- The solubility of a substance depends on the **strength** of the **InterMolecular Forces within the solute** and **within the solvent** (cohesive forces), in comparison to the **IMF** between the solute and solvent (adhesive forces).

- The generalisation is that **polar compounds** tend to only dissolve well in **polar compounds** and **non-polar** compounds only dissolve in **non-polar compounds**.

- Hydrocarbons are soluble in each other as well as in non-polar organic compounds such as benzene, diethyl ether and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane). 
- This is because the **cohesive forces** within the solvent are also **weak dispersion forces** that are **similar in strength to the dispersion forces within hydrocarbons**.

### Density

- Density is the measure of mass per unit volume ${g/mL\text{ or }g/cm^{3}}$

| Alkane      | Formula       | Density $(g/cm^{3}\text{ at }20\degC)$ | Molecular Mass $(g/mol)$ |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pentane     | $\ce{C5H12}$  | 0.626                                  | 72.15                    |
| Decane      | $\ce{C10H22}$ | 0.730                                  | 142.3                    |
| Pentadecane | $\ce{C15H32}$ | 0.768                                  | 212.4                    |
| Isosane     | $\ce{C20H42}$ | 0.789                                  | 282.6                    |

- Alkanes cannot mix with water → If you try, the alkane will float on top of the water
- This is because all alkanes have a lower density than water

### Volatility

Volatility is the **ability of a liquid** (or solid) **to escape and form a vapour**. ↑ BP→↑ IMF Strength→↑ Volatility Volatility is measured by **vapour pressure**, which is a measure of concentration in the gas phase above the liquid. It is **constant** at a **constant temperature**.

Hydrocarbons are **non-polar** and hence have **dispersion forces** as their only **intermolecular force**. Since the intermolecular forces are **relatively weak**, their **bonds are easily overcome** and hence the **BP is relatively low**. Therefore, hydrocarbons will be volatile.

> ↑ Molecular Mass → ↑ Strength of dispersion forces → ↑ 𝐸h𝑒𝑎𝑡 → ↓ Volatility at a constant temperature.

### Viscosity

Viscosity refers to a substance’s **resistance to fluid flow.** Liquids with a relatively high resistance to flow have high viscosity. For a substance to flow, particles must flow over each other. Viscosity depends on:

- Strength of intermolecular forces. ↑ IMF→↑ Viscosity

- Size of molecules. ↑ Size→↑ Viscosity

- Temperature. ↑ Temperature→↓ Viscosity

  Viscosity decreases with **increasing temperature**. At higher temperatures, molecules have **greater kinetic energy**. Thus, the molecules move around more which increases the space between molecules. This causes the **intermolecular forces** to be **weaker** and **hence viscosity decreases**.

## Functional Groups

A functional group is an **atom or group of atoms** which give a compound **some characteristic physical** and **chemical property**.

A homologous **series** is a family of organic compounds with the **same general formula** or **functional groups** with **similar chemical properties**.

### Alcohols (Alkanols)

Alcohols are formed when one of the hydrogens on the end of the chain has been replaced with an -OH group

#### Naming

1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon that contains the functional group
2. Replace the ane/ene/yne with -ol
3. Name the substituents as prefixes in alphabetical order
4. Number the chain so that the functional group has the lowest possible number

Alcohols can also be classified according to the number of carbon atoms attached to the carbon bearing the -OH group.

- A **primary** (1°) alcohol is one in which the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to **one** other carbon atom.
- A **secondary** (2°) alcohol is one in which the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to **two** other carbon atoms.
- A **tertiary** (3°) alcohol is one in which the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to **three** other carbon atoms.

### Aldehydes and Ketones (Carbonyl Group)

A **carbonyl** functional group consists of carbon attached to an **oxygen atom** by a **double bond**. The difference between **aldehydes** (**alkanals**) and **ketones** (**alkanone**) is the **position** of the carbonyl group along the carbon chain:

- If the carbonyl group is on a **terminal** carbon (at the end of a chain), it is called an **aldehyde**, which is given the suffix “**-al**”.
- If the carbonyl group is in the **middle** of the carbon chain, it is called a **ketone**, which is given the suffix “**-** **one”**.

#### Naming

- When the **aldehyde** is the **suffix**, the aldehyde carbon is assigned the number 1. Since it is always carbon 1, “1” (terminal carbon) is omitted from the name. (“-al”) e.g. 2-methylbutanal
- When the **ketone** is the **suffix**, the carbon chain is numbered so that the ketone is assigned the **lowest number**. (“-one”) e.g. Pentan-3-one.

### Carboxylic Acids (Alkanoic Acids)

Carboxylic acids contain the carbonyl group, C=O, connected to a **hydroxyl** group. The carboxyl group is abbreviated as -COOH, and is given by the **suffix** “**-oic acid**”. 

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Carboxylic-acid.svg" theme="light" caption="Carboxylic Acid Functional Group, where R represents the rest of the molecule." >}}

Since the carboxylic acid **uses up 3 bonds** on the carbon atom, it must be situated at the **end of the chain** (terminal carbon).

#### Naming

Unfortunately, the carboxylic acids have different names each. However, some of them should be familiar.

| IUPAC Name                                | Formula                 | Common Name    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Methanoic Acid                            | $\ce{HCOOH}$            | Formic Acid    |
| Ethanoic Acid                             | $\ce{CH3COOH}$          | Acetic Acid    |
| Propanoic Acid                            | $\ce{CH3CH2COOH}$       | Propionic Acid |
| Butanoic Acid                             | $\ce{CH3CH2CH2COOH}$    | Butyric Acid   |
| Pentanoic Acid                            | $\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH}$ | Valeric Acid   |
| 2-Hydroxypropanoic Acid                   | $\ce{HC3H5O6}$          | Lactic Acid    |
| 2-Hydroxypropane-1,2,3-Tricarboxylic Acid | $\ce{H2C6H5O7}$         | Citric Acid    |

{{< figure src="https://images.schoolnotes.xyz/uploads/citric-acid_lewis.svg" theme="light" caption="2-Hydroxypropane-1,2,3-Tricarboxylic Acid, more often referred to as Citric Acid, with each functional group coloured. You don't need to know this for your HSC, relax." >}}

### Amines and Amides

- Amines and Amides both contain nitrogen
- Amines contain $\ce{NH2}$, and use the suffix "-amine" or the prefix "amino-"
- **Amides** are **carboxylic acids** where the OH group has been replaced with an **amine.** They use the **suffix** “**amide**”.
- When they are quoted as the prefix, the carbonyl and the amine are named separately (using the prefixes “oxo” and “amino” respectively).

### Halogenated Organic Compounds

- Halogenated organic compounds have had hydrogen atoms replaced with a halogen (group 17 element)
- They are named using prefixes placed in front of the name of the alkane
  - e.g. di**fluoro**pentane

### Naming Priorities of Function Groups

- The highest priority functional group takes the suffix, and the other functional groups are placed earlier in the name. 

- Aldehyde > Ketone > Alcohol > Alkyne = Alkene

| Name                     | Structure                   | Suffix    | Prefix                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Carboxylic/Alkanoic Acid | $\ce{R-COOH}$               | -oic acid |                                                              |
| Amide                    | $\ce{R-CONH2}$              | -amide    | Oxo- & Amino- (The carbonyl & amine groups are named as if they were separate) |
| Aldehyde (Alkanal)       | $\ce{R-COH}$                | -al       | Oxo-                                                         |
| Ketone (Alkanone)        | $\ce{R\prime-CO-R}$         | -one      | Oxo-                                                         |
| Alcohol (Alkanol)        | $\ce{R-OH}$                 | -ol       | Hydroxy-                                                     |
| Amine                    | $\ce{R-NH2}$                | -amine    | -amino-                                                      |
| Alkene                   | $\ce{R - CH = CH -R\prime}$ | -ene      | -ene-                                                        |

## Structural Isomers

### Isomers

- Structural isomers are molecules that have the **same molecular formula,** but their atoms are arranged in different ways, giving rise to **different structural formulae**.

- Although isomers have the same molecular formula, they are different compounds with **different chemical** and **physical properties**, as well as different names.

### Chain Isomers

Chain isomers involve **rearrangement** of the carbons in the **backbone,** resulting in a different number of carbons in the longest chain or different branching in the carbon chain.

##### Example: Hexane

- An alkane with the molecular formula $\ce{C6H14}$ has 5 chain isomers
- Each isomer has the same molecular formula, but a different name

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Hexane_isomers.svg" theme="light" caption="The 5 hexane chain isomers: hexane, 2 methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane." >}}

### Position Isomers

- Position isomers occur when molecules have the same **carbon chain,** but the **functional group** is at a **different** **location**.

- Position isomers only exist for molecules that **contain functional groups**, where the chain is long enough for the functional group to occupy different positions. (Eg. Not possible for ethene or ethane).

##### Example: Butene

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/1-butene.svg" theme="light" caption="But-1-ene" >}}

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Cis-2-butene.svg" theme="light" caption="But-2-ene" >}}

### Functional Group Isomers

Functional group isomers result when the atoms in the molecules are **arrange in different ways** that lead to the isomers having **different functional groups**.

##### Example: $\ce{C3H6O2}\newcommand{orange}{\color{orange}}$

- Propanoic Acid and 1-hydroxypropan-2-one arefunctional group isomers, with the same molecular formula $(\ce{C3H6O2}),$ but different arrangements of atoms:
- Propanoic Acid contains a carboxyl functional group, while 1-hydroxypropan-2-one contains hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups

{{< figure src="/jsdelivr-proxy/gh/psharma04/image-repo@main/uploads/propanoic-acid_lewis.svg" theme="light" caption="Propanoic Acid" >}}

{{< figure src="/jsdelivr-proxy/gh/psharma04/image-repo@latest/uploads/1-hydroxypropan-2-one.svg" theme="light" caption="1-hydroxypropan-2-one" >}}

## Hydrocarbon Reactions

### Combustion Reactions

> This is what chemistry is all about, isn't it? Setting things on fire and seeing what happens.

- All combustion reactions are **exothermic**. It may be **complete** or **incomplete.** 
- For complete combustion to occur, **excess oxygen** must be readily available, and the products are always **carbon dioxide** and **water.**

> $\orange{\ce{C8H18(l) + 25/2O2(g)→8CO2(g) +9H2O(l)}}$

- Incomplete combustion occurs when there is **insufficient oxygen**. The products are **water** and **three** different oxidations of carbon, **soot, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide**.

- Incomplete combustion results in **less energy** being produce per mole of fuel combustion, making it **less efficient**. 
- This is due to the reduction of C=O bonds being formed. The formation of C=O releases a large amount of energy.
- Alkenes and alkynes tend to burn with a more **sooty flame** compared to alkanes due to the **higher percentage of carbon atoms**. Some of the carbon may not combine with oxygen.
- Standard molar heat of combustion is the energy **released**. Therefore, it is **positive**.
- Standard enthalpy of combustion is **always negative** as combustion is exothermic. It is the **change in enthalpy**.

### Reactions of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons

#### Stability of Carbon Bonds

- The bond energies dictate the overall reactivity of hydrocarbon compounds. **Subsequent carbon-carbon bonds** in a multiple bond are less stable and **weaker** than the original single covalent bond.
- This means that **double** and **triple bonds** are **highly reactive** and can break open more easily and allow atoms to join (saturate).
- This makes the **alkenes** and **alkynes highly reactive** compared to alkanes.
- Alkenes and alkynes are able to react with a number of chemical reactions called **addition reactions**

#### Addition Reactions of Alkenes - Hydrogenation

- Alkenes react with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst to form a **saturated alkane.**

> $\orange{\text{General Formula: }\ce{Alkene +H2(g)→[Ni]Saturated Alkane}}$

#### Addition Reactions of Alkenes - Bromination and Chlorination

- Bromine and chlorine add to almost all alkenes very rapidly at STP, creating a compound that has 2 bromines/chlorines on adjacent carbons
- This occurs spontaneously at STP, and can be used as an indicator for alkenes and alkynes

#### Addition of HX (Hydrohalogenation)

- Any of the hydrogen halides (HF, HCl, HBr and HI) can add to the double bond of an alkane to give the corresponding alkyl halide. 
- The double bond is converted into a single bond.

#### Predicting a Major Product

- When an asymmetric reagent, such as HBr is added to an asymmetric alkene, more of one isomer is produced than the other.

- The predominant isomer is called the **major product** and the other isomer(s) is called the **minor product(s)**.
- In some reactions, only the major product will be formed.
- The major product obtained from an addition reaction can be predicted using **Markovnikov’s rule**.
- In addition, for reactions involving unsymmetrical alkenes, the hydrogen atom will predominantly bond to the **carbon atom bearing the greater number of hydrogen atoms**.

#### Addition of Water (Hydration)

- Water alone does not react with alkenes, but if an aqueous acid catalyst (eg. Dilute H2SO4) is added and the mixture is heated, water adds to the C=C double bond to give an alkanol.

#### Addition Reactions of Alkynes

- Alkynes undergo addition reactions in a similar fashion to alkenes.

- - One of the three bonds in the triple bond is broken, and two new bonds form. The original triple bond is converted into a double bond.
  - The second addition reaction can be stopped by controlling equivalents of reagent used or by using a specialised reagent.

#### Hydration of Alkynes

- Alkynes do not react with water with only an acid catalyst. A mercury(II) catalyst, such as **mercury(II) sulfate**, must also be present.
- A **carbonyl** (ketone or aldehyde) is produced instead of an alcohol. The alcohol forms as an intermediate which quickly rearranges to form the carbonyl.

#### Substitution Reactions of Alkanes

- A substitution reaction occurs when an **atom** or **functional group** in a molecule is **replaced or substituted** by another atom or group.
- Alkanes are far less reactive than alkanes and alkynes as C-C single bonds are **relatively strong**. 
- However, their **hydrogen atoms** can be **substituted by halogens**. 
- These reactions do not occur spontaneously at RTP.
- Substitution of alkanes can only be carried out with **chlorine** and **bromine** (fluorine reacts too explosively, and iodine does not react) and required energy in the form of **ultraviolet (UV) radiation**.

## Physical Properties of Alkanols

> In case you forgot, alkanols and alcohols are the same thing, its just that the names tend to be -nol, its just  easier to remember if we consistently use Alkanol (i.e. Alkane + nol)

### Intermolecular and Intramolecular Bonding Forces of Alkanols

- Alkanols contain highly electronegative oxygen atoms, creating a polar bond in the molecule.
- The hydrocarbon chain is still non-polar, and has dispersion/Van Der Waals forces.
  - The hydrocarbon end of the molecule repels water.
- The -OH functional group is polar, forming hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole bonds, ion-dipole bonds, and dispersion bonds.
  - This end is attracted to water.
- As the chain length of an alcohol increases, the **strength of the dispersion force increases**. However, the extent of **hydrogen bonding** does **not change.**
- The strength of the **hydrogen bonding** depends primarily on the molecule’s **shape** and the **number of hydrogen bond donors** and **acceptors available.**
- Thus the **length** of the hydrocarbon chain **influences** the **properties** within the homologous series of alcohols, and the hydroxyl group influences the differences in properties between alcohols and other homologous series.

### Melting and Boiling Points of Alkanols

- ↑ Chain length→↑Molecular mass→↑ Strength of dispersion forces→↑BP and ↑ MP.
- However, the shape of ethanol and methanol allow them to pack more closely together than propan-1-ol, thus resulting in stronger intermolecular forces and a higher MP.
- The position of the hydroxyl group within the molecule can also affect the melting and boiling point of alcohols
- For example, butan-2-ol has a lower boiling point than butan-1-ol
- Secondary and tertiary alkanols have lower boiling points than their primary isomers
- The dispersion forces will be the same for all three isomers
- However, hydrogen bonding is weaker for secondary and tertiary alkanols, as the alkyl group adjacent to the OH group hinders the OH group's ability to get close to another molecule, restricting their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds
- As a result, the lower boiling points arise from weaker hydrogen bonding in secondary and tertiary alkanols.
