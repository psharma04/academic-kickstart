## Ion Identification

### Chemical Monitoring and Management

- Chemical monitoring and management are needed to ensure the health and wellbeing of plants, animals, and humans.
- Monitoring also allows for preservation and maintenance of natural landscapes.
  - For example, monitoring the Ozone layer allowed for the identification of the destructiveness of CFCs (as seen in module 7), enabling manufacturers to reduce their usage of these hazardous chemicals
  - Compounds of mercury, arsenic, and other hazardous elements have been identified and monitored through chemical techniques.
  - Nutrient-rich soil and land fertility can be determined via chemical analysis.

### Qualitative Ion Analysis - Key Terms

- **Precipitate -** insoluble salt formed when 2 ionic solutions are mixed.
- **Qualitative Analysis -** Identification of the constituent components of a sample (e.g. there is selenium, arsenic, and phosphorus in this sample of ore)
- **Quantitative Analysis -** Measurement/Determination of the quantities of the constituents of a sample (e.g. there is 30g of Mercury per 1kg of soil)
- **Destructive Testing -** Any testing which irreversibly alters the composition of a sample (e.g. melting it in acid)

### Qualitative Ion Analysis - Precipitation Reactions

- You DEFINITELY need to know your solubility rules for this module.
- In the following table, higher rules take precedence. For example, $\ce{Li2CO3}$ is soluble, because the rule about group 1 being soluble takes priority over the rule about carbonates being insoluble.

| Rule                                               | Special Exceptions                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Group 1 and ammonium compounds are **soluble**     | None                                           |
| Nitrate Salts and Acetate Salts are **soluble**    | None                                           |
| Iodide, Chloride and Bromide salts are **soluble** | $\ce{Ag+,Pb+,Hg+}$                             |
| Sulfate salts are **soluble**                      | $\ce{Ag+,Pb^{2+},Hg+,Ba^{2+},Ca^{2+},Sr^{2+}}$ |
| Hydroxide salts are **insoluble**                  | $Ba^{2+},Ca^{2+}$ are slightly soluble         |
| Carbonates and Phosphates are insoluble            | None                                           |

#### Precipitation Colours

- One of the easiest ways to identify the components of a compound is through a precipitation reaction. As different compounds produce different colored precipitates, you can use the table below to find which ions are present in the precipitate.

{{< figure src="https://schoolnotes.xyz/statically-image-cdn/uploads/Yr12-Chemistry-Solubility-Chart.png" caption="Colors of precipitates for different reactions. Trends can be easily found going left to right." >}}

- For example, say you have an unknown substance, which can be dissolved in water.
- After adding Sulfuric acid to the compound, you notice that a blue precipitate is formed.
- From this, you can assume that the cation of your unknown was probably Copper (II) $\left(\ce{Cu^{2+}}\right)$.
- Precipitation reactions are a form of **destructive testing**. Essentially, whatever quantity of the sample you used to perform the precipitation reaction is no longer usable as the original compound.
- Had the unknown been, say, Copper (II) Phosphate, then whatever amount you used in the precipitation reaction is no longer Copper (II) Phosphate, and so has been effectively "destroyed" (not really destroyed, because of Conservation of Mass).
