## Ion Identification

### Chemical Monitoring and Management

- Chemical monitoring and management are needed to ensure the health and wellbeing of plants, animals, and humans.
- Monitoring also allows for preservation and maintenance of natural landscapes.
  - For example, monitoring the Ozone layer allowed for the identification of the destructiveness of CFCs (as seen in module 7), enabling manufacturers to reduce their usage of these hazardous chemicals
  - Compounds of mercury, arsenic, and other hazardous elements have been identified and monitored through chemical techniques.
  - Nutrient-rich soil and land fertility can be determined via chemical analysis.

### Qualitative Ion Analysis - Key Terms

- **Precipitate -** insoluble salt formed when 2 ionic solutions are mixed.
- **Qualitative Analysis -** Identification of the constituent components of a sample (e.g. there is selenium, arsenic, and phosphorus in this sample of ore)
- **Quantitative Analysis -** Measurement/Determination of the quantities of the constituents of a sample (e.g. there is 30g of Mercury per 1kg of soil)
- **Destructive Testing -** Any testing which irreversibly alters the composition of a sample (e.g. melting it in acid)

### Qualitative Ion Analysis - Precipitation Reactions

- You DEFINITELY need to know your solubility rules for this module.
- In the following table, higher rules take precedence. For example, $\ce{Li2CO3}$ is soluble, because the rule about group 1 being soluble takes priority over the rule about carbonates being insoluble.

| Rule                                               | Special Exceptions                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Group 1 and ammonium compounds are **soluble**     | None                                           |
| Nitrate Salts and Acetate Salts are **soluble**    | None                                           |
| Iodide, Chloride and Bromide salts are **soluble** | $\ce{Ag+,Pb+,Hg+}$                             |
| Sulfate salts are **soluble**                      | $\ce{Ag+,Pb^{2+},Hg+,Ba^{2+},Ca^{2+},Sr^{2+}}$ |
| Hydroxide salts are **insoluble**                  | $Ba^{2+},Ca^{2+}$ are slightly soluble         |
| Carbonates and Phosphates are insoluble            | None                                           |

#### Precipitation Colours

- One of the easiest ways to identify the components of a compound is through a precipitation reaction. As different compounds produce different colored precipitates, you can use the table below to find which ions are present in the precipitate.

{{< figure src="https://schoolnotes.xyz/statically-image-cdn/uploads/Yr12-Chemistry-Solubility-Chart.png" caption="Colors of precipitates for different reactions. Trends can be easily found going left to right." >}}

- For example, say you have an unknown substance, which can be dissolved in water.
- After adding Sulfuric acid to the compound, you notice that a blue precipitate is formed.
- From this, you can assume that the cation of your unknown was probably Copper (II) $\left(\ce{Cu^{2+}}\right)\newcommand{orange}{\color{orange}}$.
- Precipitation reactions are a form of **destructive testing**. Essentially, whatever quantity of the sample you used to perform the precipitation reaction is no longer usable as the original compound.
- Had the unknown been, say, Copper (II) Phosphate, then whatever amount you used in the precipitation reaction is no longer Copper (II) Phosphate, and so has been effectively "destroyed" (not really destroyed, because of Conservation of Mass).

### Complexation Reactions

- Complexation reactions can be used to identify transition metal ions, such as $\ce{Ag+,Cu^{2+},Fe^{2+}, and Pb^{2+}}.$

- A complexation occurs when a "coordination compound" forms:

  - Coordination compounds are made up of a central cation, coordinated to anions or polar molecules.
  - The coordinating substances (the anions and polar molecules) are known as Ligands, and are either neutral or negatively charged.
  - Examples include $\ce{H2O,NH3,Cl-, and CN-}$ (water, ammonia, chloride, and cyanide)

- Coordination complexes typically have distinct colours, which is how we can use them for qualitative analysis.

- They have special notation as well (because IUPAC loves special notations):

  - Coordination complexes are indicated by square brackets: $\ce{[Cu(OH2)6]^{2+}}$ is called a "hexaaquacopper (II)" ion:
    - "Hexa-" = 6
    - "Aqua-" = water

  {{< figure src="https://images.schoolnotes.xyz/uploads/jo61v.png" theme="light" caption="Hexaaquacopper (II) ion diagram.">}}

- You don't actually need to know the names, but you do need to know the notation.

### Water Complexation

{{< callout note >}}

Pro tip: You can use "Rx" as shorthand for "reaction". I actually just have it as a keyboard shortcut at this point because I'm too lazy to type the 6 extra letters.

{{< /callout >}}

- When transition metal ions dissolve in water, a complexation reaction occurs.
- For example, Iron (II) Chloride:

$$\ce{FeCl2_{(aq)} +6H2O_{(l)}â†’ [Fe(OH2)6]^{2+}_{(aq)} +2Cl-_{(aq)}}$$

- Water molecules (ligands) coordinate with the transition metal
- Charge stays the same as the original cation (Iron and Chloride dissociate in water, because polar-polar solution)

### Complexation Identification

- Complexation reactions can be used in conjunction with precipitation to identify ions
- For example, Silver Halides can be distinguished due to their complexation in Ammonia:
  - $\ce{AgCl}$ is soluble in dilute ammonia $(\ce{AgCl +2NH3<=> [Ag(NH3)2]+ +Cl-})$
  - $\ce{AgBr}$ is soluble in concentrated ammonia $(\ce{AgBr +2NH3 <=> [Ag(NH3)2]+ +Br-})$
  - $\ce{AgI}$ is insoluble in ammonia
- This can be used to distinguish between Silver (II) and Lead (II), because Lead (II) Chloride doesn't dissolve in ammonia.
- Complexation tests can also be used to confirm predictions:
  - Iron (III) ions react with thiocyanates $(\ce{SCN-})$ to produce blood red $\ce{[Fe(SCN)]^{2+}}$
  - Copper (II) ions react with ammonia to form a pale blue $\ce{Cu(OH)2}$, which then dissolves to form a darker blue $\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$

### Flame Tests!!!

{{< callout note >}}

Honestly my favourite part of chemistry: setting things on fire just to see what comes out.

{{< /callout >}}

- A flame test is used to qualitatively identify some metal ions in a sample. 
- It can be used to distinguish between cations that undergo similar precipitation reactions. 
- For example, $\ce{Ba^{2+}}$ and $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ or Group 1 metals. 
- However, not all metals produce a diagnostic flame colour.

#### Atomic Emission

{{< callout note >}}

This crosses over heavily with [Physics Module 7 spectroscopy content.](/courses/physics-hsc/physics-module-7/#spectroscopy)

{{< /callout >}}

- The colour of a flame test is a product of the atomic emissions of a metal.
- The heat energy from the flame excites electrons within the metal, making them jump to higher energy levels.
- When the electron attempts to drop back down, it releases the energy in the form of light.
- Due to physics things (the "quantum" part of quantum mechanics is what explains this), every element has a specific set of wavelengths it will emit in this manner (influenced by the different binding energies between the electron and nucleus, distance from the nucleus, repulsion by other electrons, etc.)
- The colours most intensely emitted by this process are what are observed in a flame test.
- Some elements have emissions in the UV or IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, so their colour isn't as pronounced as other elements.

{{< figure src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/image-repo/main/uploads/Stimulated_Emission.min.svg" theme="light" caption="Diagram of how a flame test works." >}}

##### Flame test colours (now with $\LaTeX$ colourisation)

| Metal Ion              | Colour                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $\ce{Ba^{2+}}$         | $\color{#a3ff00}{\text{Apple Green}}$      |
| $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$         | $\color{#DD6E0F}{\text{Brick Red/Orange}}$ |
| $\ce{Mg^{2+}}$         | No characteristic colour                   |
| $\ce{Pb^{2+}}$         | $\color{#6699cc}{\text{Grey-Blue}}$        |
| $\ce{Cu^{2+}}$         | $\color{green}{\text{Green}}$              |
| $\ce{Fe^{2+}/Fe^{3+}}$ | $\color{#996600}{\text{Orange-Brown}}$     |
| $\ce{Ag+}$             | No characteristic colour                   |

#### Limitations of the Flame Test

- Can only be used for some metal cations
- Destructive test
- Can be ambiguous due to similar colours
- Different oxidisation states cannot be determined, such as Iron (II) and Iron (III)
- Interference can be caused by other metal ions

### Additional Tests for Ion Identification

- Conjugates of strong acids and bases will dissolve to produce a solution with neutral pH. Conjugates of weak acids/bases will produce a non-neutral pH.

| Basic Ion | Neutral Ion |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Hydroxide | Chloride    |
| Acetate   | Bromide     |
| Carbonate | Iodide      |
| Phosphate | Sulfate     |

- Carbonate anions can be identified via acid-carbonate reactions (product of $\ce{CO2}$ bubbles can be tested through limewater)

{{< figure src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/image-repo/main/uploads/mermaid/cation-test.min.svg" theme="dark" caption="Cation identification flowchart (click to enlarge)" >}}

### Identifying Anions

{{< figure src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/image-repo/main/uploads/mermaid/anion-test.min.svg" theme="dark" caption="Anion identification flowchart (click to enlarge)" >}}

## Gravimetric Analysis

- Gravimetric analysis uses the mass of product (precipitate) formed through a precipitate reaction to quantify a target ion. 
- It is used in applications such as monitoring water quality, determining the mineral composition of soil and product testing.

- There are 3 main steps:
  1. A known quantity of a sample is dissolved in water.
  2. The target ion is precipitated using a reagent (excess reagent should be added).
  3. The precipitate is collected by filtration, then washed, dried, and weighed.

- The reagent used must react selectively with the target ion AND form a highly insoluble precipitate in order to provide accurate results.
- The reagent can be chosen using the [solubility rules](#qualitative-ion-analysis---precipitation-reactions), while the precipitate's solubility can be found by [calculating the solubility product constant $(K_{sp})$](/courses/chemistry-hsc/chemistry-equation-guide/#solubility-equilibrium)
- The quantity of the target ion is (usually) expressed as a % mass of the original sample

### Assumptions of Gravimetric Analysis

{{< callout note >}}

You may be asked to discuss the validity of gravimetric analysis. If so, this is the section for you.

{{< /callout >}}

Gravimetric analysis assumes that:

- Only the target ion precipitates out.
- 100% of the target ion present in the sample precipitates out.
- All of the precipitate is collected.
- All of the collected substance is a pure sample of the precipitate.

 ### Sulfate Content of Fertiliser (Practical)

- Fertilisers contain ammonium sulfate $(\ce{(NH4)2SO4})$ as a sulfur source for plants.
- The amount of sulfate can be determined through gravimetric analysis, by adding a Barium reagent to form the highly insoluble $\ce{BaSO4}$.
  - Barium can precipitate carbonate, chloride, phosphate, and hydroxide anions too.
  - To precipitate carbonates, add acid in excess
  - To precipitate phosphate and hydroxide, acidify the solution (don't use sulfuric acid though)
  - To precipitate chloride, add silver nitrate in excess.
- If other anions precipitate with Barium, the mass of the residue will increase. Therefore, a higher concentration will be calculated.

### Pros and Cons of Gravimetric Analysis

| Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Very accurate (assuming experimental design is correct)      | Target ion must be able to form a highly insoluble precipitate |
| Doesn't require specialty equipment, just normal lab gear    | Precipitate must be highly pure                              |
| Does not require a calibration curve, which can take up more time | Much more time consuming than modern techniques              |
|                                                              | Concentration of the target ion must be high enough to produce a precipitate that can be accurately measured |

## Precipitation Titrations

{{< callout note >}}

It's module 6 all over again! If you need a refresher, [this link goes to the titration section of the module 6 post.](/courses/chemistry-hsc/module-6/#titration)

{{< /callout >}}

- Precipitation titrations are commonly used to find the concentration and quantity of halides (fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide)
- Usually, silver compounds are the titrant, so this style of titration gets a special name: argentometric titration.
- There are 3 main methods of titration: Mohr's, Volhard's, and Fajan's.

### Mohr's Method (Direct Titration)

- Quantifies chloride, bromide, and cyanide ions using direct titration, with a standard silver solution.

$$\orange{\ce{Ag_{(aq)}+ +X_{(aq)}- â†’AgX_{(s)}}}$$

- Yellow Potassium Chromate $(\ce{K2CrO4})$ is used as the indicator.
- Silver preferentially precipitates with halides, and when excess silver is added it will react with chromate ions to produce a reddish-brown precipitate $(\ce{Ag2CrO4})$.

#### Limitations of Mohr's Method

- The presence of multiple anions in a sample can lead to invalid results, especially in the cases of carbonate and phosphate (which precipitate readily with silver)

- The conical flask must be thoroughly stirred during the titration to ensure the silver ions are evenly distributed, so that silver chromate does not precipitate early
- Titration must be conducted between pH 6.5 and 9.0:
  - At pH < 6.5, the chromate ion (a weak base) accepts $\ce{H+}$ to become $\ce{HCrO4-,}$ so there will not be enough chromate in solution to produce the end point colour change. $\ce{HCrO4-}$ is also bright orange, which obscures the endpoint.
  - At pH > 9.0, the concentration of $\ce{OH-}$ is too high. It will form a precipitate with $\ce{Ag}$ to produce $\ce{AgOH}$ which is a brown precipitate. It also obscures the endpoint and increases the silver needed to reach it.

- Mohrâ€™s method is suitable for the analysis of chloride and bromide ions, but not iodide or thiocyanate ions. 
  - This is because the chromate ions are strongly adsorbed to the surface of $\ce{AgI}$ and $\ce{AgSCN}$ precipitates, making the endpoint indistinct.
- In this precipitation titration, the concentration of the indicator used is quite low as adding too much chromate indicator will lead to an intense yellow colour which masks the end point. 
  - As a result, the excess titrant required to cause a colour change is relatively large.
  - $\ce{2Ag+ +CrO4^{2-} <=>Ag2CrO4}$
  - Small concentrations of chromate mean that the equilibrium is towards the left. To shift it right, large amounts of silver needs to be added.
  - This excess silver leads to a systematic error, although this can be corrected using a blank titration:
    - The same quantity of chromate indictor is to be used in the titration is added to a suspension of calcium carbonate (which imitates the white $\ce{AgX}$ precipitate).
    - $\ce{AgNO3}$ is added to the solution until a colour change occurs.
    - The volume of $\ce{AgNO3}$ required to cause the colour change in the blank is the excess volume required. 
    - This volume is subtracted from the titration volumes.

### Volhard's Method (Back Titration)

Volhard's method quantifies anions using back titration.

- A known, **excess** quantity of silver nitrate is added to the sample to precipitate all of the analyte ions.
  - $\ce{Ag+ +X- â†’AgX}$
- The excess silver nitrate is determined by back titration against a Potassium Thiocyanate $(\ce{KSCN})$ standard solution.
  - $\ce{Ag+ +SCN- â†’AgSCN}$
- A small amount of Iron (III) is added as an indicator. When excess thiocyanate is present, there will be a permanent color change.
  - $\ce{Fe^{3+} +SCN- â†’ [Fe(SCN)]^{2+}}$

#### Limitations of Volhard's Method

{{< callout note >}}

Can we just take a minute to appreciate the name Volhard? Also, most textbooks have a fairly limited explanation of this method, so we went to the NSW State Library, found someone who speaks and reads German well enough to do science, and asked them to translate the thing for us. [We also got permission to upload a scan of the paper to IPFS, so you can find it here (if you can read German, that is).](https://schoolnotes.xyz/ipfs-1/QmfDDsHFXUHqYekXCmLNTzbd9oXXvu9e6TCTPRWse4doyP)

{{< /callout >}}

- Volhard's method must be performed in low pH to prevent the precipitation of Iron (III) as $\ce{Fe(OH)3}.$ At low H, there is relatively low amounts of hydroxide ions, so no Iron (II) Hydroxide will form.
- The Volhard method is less valid if the first precipitate is more soluble than silver thiocyanate.
  - For example, $\ce{AgCl}, (K_{sp}=1.77\times10^{-10})$ is more soluble than $\ce{AgSCN}, (K_{sp}=1.03\times10^{-12}),$ so the silver chloride will dissolve during the titration, leading to a greater titre volume.
  - This can be avoided by filtering the first precipitate out, but this can lead to inaccuracies.

### Fajan's Method (Direct Titration and Adsorption Indicator)

In the analysis of chlorise, an anionic dye is added to the sample.

- A standard solution of silver nitrate is added, and the precipitation occurs.
  - $\ce{Ag+ +Cl- â†’AgCl}$
- Before the equivalence point, a small excess of chloride ions is incorporated into the precipitate, so it carries a negative charge. The dye is repelled and remains in solution.
- After the equivalence point, there is a small excess of silver ions. Therefore, the precipitate becomes slightly positively charged, and the dye adsorbs onto it, resulting in a precipitate colour change.
  - The most suitable indicator depends on the analyte.

#### Limitations of Fajan's Method

- Fajanâ€™s method relies on a large precipitate surface area, to allow sufficient dye to adsorb so the colour change is easily visible.
  - Dextrin (starch) can be added to prevent silver halide precipitates from aggregating
  - A high concentration of spectator ions can also caused aggregation, so this method cannot be used with all samples.
- The analyte must also be concentrated enough, as the colour will not be seen if there is too little precipitate.
- The pH of the titration reaction must be carefully controlled as anionic dye indicators are conjugate bases of weak acids. This means it will react with free $\ce{H+}$ and will not adsorb onto the surface of the precipitate.

## Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy

{{< callout note >}}

- Atomic absorption is explained by both the Bohr and Schrodinger models of the atom.
- However, for simplicity, the chemistry syllabus explains it in terms of the Bohr model (physics spends an entire chapter of most textbooks to get the Schrodinger explanation)

{{< /callout >}}

### Atomic Absorption

The Bohr model of the atom where electrons are contained in shells around the nucleus of the atom:

- The further away from the nucleus, the higher the energy level of the shell
- These shells have discrete or quantised energy levels
- The lowest energy electronic configuration of an atom is called the ground state

- When electrons in the ground state (gas) absorb light energy (photons) corresponding to a difference between levels, they are excited to a higher energy level.
- The light that passes through the sample without being absorbed can be collected as an absorption spectrum.

- The absorbed wavelengths of light can be seen as black lines on a bright background.
- The energies of the absorbed wavelengths match energy gaps between two shells.
- As each element has a unique set of energy levels, the wavelengths of light absorbed by each element is characteristic.

{{< figure src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/image-repo/main/uploads/Stimulated_Emission.min.svg" theme="light" caption="Yes I know it's the same image from earlier, because both flame tests and AAS work on the same principle!" >}}

### AAS

- Atomic absorption spectroscopy is a sensitive and highly selective technique that can be used to measure small concentrations of metal ions. 
- It has an important role in the detection of toxic heavy metals.
- In AAS, the concentration of the analyte is calculated from the amount of each wavelength of light absorbed by the sample.
  - The wavelength used in the analysis is based on atomic absorptions of the analyte.
  - The amount of light absorbed is called the absorbance. It is determined from the relative intensities of light before and after the sample.

$$\orange{A=\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{0}}{I}\right)}$$

- Where $A$ is the absorbance, $I_0$ is the intensity of light before the sample, and $I$ is the intensity after the sample.
- Measured absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample.

### How does AAS Work?

{{< figure src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/image-repo/main/uploads/Spectroscopy_overview.min.svg" theme="light" caption="Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy Diagram." >}}

1. An aqueous solution of sample is drawn up through a fine capillary tube into a nebuliser which turns it into a fine mist.
2. Carrier gases (air and acetylene) sweeps the droplets into the furnace, which burns the solvent off and atomises the sample (to their ground states).
3. The hollow cathode lamp emits wavelengths of light matching the energy gaps of the element being analysed through the atomised sample
4. Analyte atoms in the sample will absorb a fraction of light
5. The remaining light passes to a monochromator which selects a wavelength of light for analysis.
6. The photomultiplier detector measures the intensity of light and replays the data to the analysis software.
7. The hollow cathode lamp contains the element which being tested. It emits a certain spectral pattern â€“ unique to each metal.

### Calibration using Standard Solutions

- The calibration curve is used to establish the relationship between measured absorbance and the analyte concentration for a particular instrument.
- It is produced by measuring the absorbance of standard solutions, because absorbance is proportional to concentration for dilute samples in AAS.
  - Best results are obtained when $0.1\leq A\leq0.8$.
  - At higher concentrations, interaction between analyte atoms affect the absorbance values, leading to inaccurate data.
  - At lower concentrations, the instrument response may not be sensitive enough.

### Applications of AAS

- Quick, easy, accurate, and highly sensitive method of determining the concentrations of elements.
- Provides a means of investigating low-concentration phenomena, such as trace nutrients and heavy metal pollution (both usually between 1-100ppm, far too small for titration analyses).

### Advantages and Disadvantages of AAS

| Advantages                                          | Disadvantages                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simple procedure                                    | High initial cost                                            |
| Very sensitive (can measure up to ppb)              | Can only test for one substance at a time (except extremely high-end equipment like drug test labs) |
| Extremely accurate                                  | Only metals and a few non-metals can be tested for           |
| Specific (can analyse individual ions in a mixture) | Cannot distinguish oxidisation states of metals              |
| Only uses small sample size                         | Destructive test                                             |
| Very fast (around 1 minute per element)             | Only tests aqueous solutions                                 |
| Very little sample preparation required             |                                                              |

## Colorimetry

- Colorimetry (not to be confused with Calorimetry, although they sound very similar) is a technique for determining the analyte concentration based on the absorbance of a coloured solution.

{{< callout note >}}

AAS and Colorimetry are essentially just more technologically advanced versions of flame tests, which proves that chemistry has moved from "set it on fire and see what happens" to "point lasers at it and see what happens". This confirms my theory that chemistry is just arson but legal.

{{< /callout >}}

- The amount of light that is absorbed by the sample is compared to the amount absorbed by a reference
  - The reference contains all components of the measured sample EXCEPT the analyte
- Coloured solutions absorb their complementary colour, which is opposite from them in the color wheel
  - A shortcut is to take "ROYGBIV" and move it along 4 places to find the complementary colour.
- The wavelength of light used in colorimetry corresponds to the strongest absorption of the analyte of interest, known as the absorption maximum $(\lambda_{max})$
  - This wavelength is used as sensitivity increases with the intensity of absorption, allowing for more accurate data to be collected.
  - However, this requires an intensely coloured analyte.

- The main coloured species analysed by colourimetry are transitional metal complexes. 

- Transition metal ions are often weakly coloured in solution, so they are commonly converted to intensely coloured transition metal complexes to allow for quantitative analysis. 

- The colour of complex ions depends on:

- - Central metal ion
  - Ligands

### How colorimetry works

{{< figure src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/image-repo/main/uploads/colorimetry-2.min.svg" theme="light" caption="Diagram of colorimetry." >}}

1. A light source provides a continuous source of white light which is narrowed and aligned into a beam using a slit.

2. A coloured filter allows a small range of wavelengths to pass through the sample, and blocks the other wavelengths.

3. The light beam passes through the sample, which absorbs a fraction of the light

4. The remaining light is transmitted through the sample and reaches the detector, which converts the

   amount of light into an electrical signal.

- The calculation of absorbance is similar to the method for AAS:

$$\orange{A=\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{0}}{I}\right)}$$

- Where $A$ is the absorbance, $I_0$ is the intensity of light passing through the **reference/blank** sample, and $I$ is the intensity of light passing through the **analyte** sample.

There is another method of calculating colorimetric absorbance:
$$A=Îµ\ell c$$

- Where $Îµ$ is the molar absorptivity (in $l/cm/mol$), $\ell$ is the path length through the sample (in cm), and $c$ is the concentration of the substance in the sample (in mol/L)
- Many factors can influence the absorbance readings therefore, it is always more accurate to construct a calibration curve by measuring the absorbance of standard solutions under the sample experimental conditions. 
- This helps to reduce systematic error.
- Similar to AAS, absorbance is proportional to concentration for samples with moderate absorbances (0.3 â€“ 2.5). Samples should be concentrated or diluted so that measured absorbances are in the range where the relationship is linear.

#### Determination of Iron Content using Colourimetry

- Due to the pale green colour of Iron (III), it cannot be directly measured using colourimetry.
- Instead, we can convert it to the distinctly coloured $\ce{[Fe(SCN)]^{2+}}$ complex:
- Iron (II) is oxidised to Iron (III) using acidified hydrogen peroxide:
  - $\ce{2Fe^{2+} +2H+ +H2O2 â†’2Fe^{3+} +4H2O}$

- Pale green Iron (III) is then reacted with colourless Thiocyanate to form the deep red Iron (III) Thiocyanate complex:

$$\bbox[5px, border: 2px dotted green]{\ce{Fe^{3+}}}+\bbox[5px, border: 2px dotted grey]{\ce{SCN-}}\rightarrow\bbox[5px, border: 2px solid red]{\ce{Fe(SCN)^{2-}}}$$

- This complex will strongly absorb blue light (complementary colour), at a wavelength around 447nm.

#### Determining Stoichiometry using Colourimetry

- Colourimetry can be used to determine the stoichiometric ration of reactants in the formation of an ionic species such as a coordination complex. 
- The absorbances of a series of solutions containing different ratios of reactants are measured at a wavelength absorbed by the product. 
- The correct stoichiometry of reactants is given at the maximum absorbance.
- The measured absorbances of the solutions are plotted against the volume of a reactant used, and the maximum absorbance is found using lines of best fit.
- The ratio of the reactants in the product corresponds to the moles combined to achieve the maximum absorbance.

### Spectroscopy of Organic Compounds

- The wavelengths absorbed by an organic molecule can be matched to its structural fragments. 
- A structural fragment that absorbs a characteristic wavelength is called a chromophore.
- The overall spectrum can also be used as a signature or fingerprint of the whole molecule. 
- By comparing the collected spectrum with a database of standards, the compound can be identified.

#### UV-Visible Spectrophotometry

- UV-visible spectrophotometers can also be used to measure the absorbance of a sample over a range of wavelengths.
- The prism is rotated so that different wavelengths (between 190 and 700nm) pass through the monochromator, sample, and detector.
- The absorbance at each wavelength is recorded, and then plotted against wavelength.
- This plot is then compared to laboratory standards to find the absorption maximum of the sample.
- This method is typically used to detect the presence of conjugation within organic molecules (where molecules have alternating double/triple and single bonds)
