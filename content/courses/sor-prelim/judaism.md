<p>


​     

<ul>


<li>Abraham, initially Abram, was the first Jewish Patriarch. God promised Him that he would be the Father of a great people if he followed God's directions

<ul>


<li>Abraham rejected paganism and was the first person to recognise a single God. As such, the Hebrews were distinguished by their faith in One God and their confidence in the Covenant between Jews and God
</li>
</ul>

<li>Abraham's story is found in Genesis. God ordered him to leave his home (Ur in Mesopotamia) and travelled to Haran “Leave your country, your relatives and your father’s home, and go to a land that I am going to show you” (Gen 12:1)

<li>It was here that God made the covenant with Abraham. The covenant was based on three promises

<ul>


<li>Promise of a relationship with God

<li>Promise of numerous descendants

<li>Promise of land
</li>
</ul>

<li>God promised Abraham to be the father of a great people, with his descendants being God's people. In return, God would provide protection and guidance and give them the land of Israel. “ancestor of a multitude of nations” (Gen17:5)<em>. </em>

<li>Abraham had a son, Ishmael, with his wife's servant at 86. He had a son with his wife Sarah when he was 100 years old and called him Isaac.

<ul>


<li>Abraham expelled Ishmael from his house
</li>
</ul>

<li>God instructed Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham obliged, highlighting his devotion and love for God. At the last second, God told him to sacrifice an animal instead

<li>Abraham, therefore is a model of Jewish life - his example is one of faith, integrity and compassion

<li>Abraham is the founder of three world religions - Islam, Judaism and Christianity, of which Judaism is the mother-faith.

<ul>


<li>All three date back to Abraham, who discovered the one true God
</li>
</ul>

<li>The Covenant was later reaffirmed at Mount Sinai through the giving of the Decalogue, revealing the way in which to act and serve God
</li>

   <td>Abraham was the first patriarch of the Jewish people. He made a covenant with God that, in return for his obedience to God's teachings, God would grant him descendants, land and a relationship with Him. So great was Abraham's love for God that, when directed, he was willing to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, in accordance with God's will. Abraham is the father of the three Abrahamic religions: Islam, Christianity and Judaism and is a model of Jewish life, as he sets an example of faith, integrity, compassion and bold loyalty to God, the sole creator.

<li>The story begins in Exodus 1, where Pharaoh orders the enslavement of Jewish people and slaughtering of Jewish new-borns

<li>To protect Moses, his mother put him in the river. He was found by Pharaoh's daughter and raised an Egyptian

<li>Study of Holy texts is embedded in belief that Judaism is constantly evolving to meet contemporary needs.

<li>Belief that the laws of the Torah and the Talmud are of divine origin, and therefore requires the following of Jewish law (halacha) yet acknowledges the human element in the sacred texts.

    <strong>Notes:</strong>

<p>


​     

<ul>


<li>Jewish people believe that God is the solve divine God, who was, is and always will be. This poses Judaism as a monotheistic religion.

<ul>


<li>“You shall have no other God before me, you shall not make for yourself an idol”
</li>
</ul>

<li>God is believed to be transcendent, immanent and the Creator. He is separate from the world, however, is still present through the Covenant with Abraham

<li>Adherents avoid material representation of God, believing he is incorporeal - as a result, they avoid iconography and physical representations of Him

<li>Jewish people believe that God is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Although God is separate from the physical world, He has a deep relationship with humanity through His love for them. Demonstrated in Genesis 1:26 "Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=NIV#fen-NIV-26a">a</a>] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

<li>God is good and everything that He creates is good. He does not act out of anger or personal preference, but rather morality itself.

<li>God is holy, “You shall be holy because I the Lord your God am holy” (Lev 19:2). Holiness ennobles ethics, which enables life

<li>Hebrew scripture describes God in three ways

<ul>


<li>As a clan - e.g. God of Abraham and his descendants

<li>God of the land of Israel - Covenant with God and Jews is lined by the land

<li>Universal God - creator of the universe
</li>
</ul>

<li>Jewish people aim to emulate the attributes of God through their lives. They do this in many ways, inclusive of the Shema; a declaration of faith proclaimed twice a day by Jewish adherents. It consists of three Torah passages. The first one demonstrates Jewish monotheism, reading "Hear, O Israel: The Hashem our God, the Hashem is one" Deuteronomy 6:4

​     

<ul>


<li>Found in the Jewish sacred text, moral law binds Jewish people to God. The main source of law is within the Torah, containing the 613 Mitzvot (commandments)

<ul>


<li>248 are positive commandments - rituals of Jewish people, obedience to covenant

<li>365 are negative commandments - actions one must refrain from doing
</li>
</ul>

<li>The Mitzvot contain all aspects of life and worship and are used by the Jewish people to express their faithfulness to the Covenant.

<li>Orthodox Jews believe that the laws were revealed to humans by God and are therefore Divine. Non-Orthodox Jews believe that the laws are divinely inspired

<li>Some Mitzvot no longer apply to modern life. Some Mitzvot apply not only to Jews, but to all people of the world.

<ul>


<li>Eg - Noahide Laws are 7 basic laws that should be followed by all people

<li>Women are exempt from some positive Mitzvot, others apply only them.

<li>The Covenant highlights the unique relationship between God and His people - it is a central expression of the faith and the identity of the Jews "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people" Leviticus 26:12

<li>The covenant serves as an immanent aspect of the Jewish faith and limits God's omnipotence by giving the Jewish people freewill. However, this comes with many moral obligations

<li>The Torah is an expression of the Covenant and is further developed in Hebrew Scriptures. The requirements of keeping the Covenant active (Halachah) are seen within the 613 Mitzvot in the written Torah

<ul>


<li>Jewish adherents return God's unbounded love by following the Halachah
</li>
</ul>

<li>Orthodox Judaism believes the Covenant's importance is through the Torah - a guide for everyday living. Progressive Judaism believes that the covenant is highlighted through the engagement of sacred texts and writings in order to live a spiritual life.

<ul>


<li>The Covenant, overall, is expressed through a deep concern for the people and state of Israel
</li>
</ul>

<li>The covenant acts as a point of communication for adherents - God engages in mundane human activity through this relationship. The covenant's main goal is to restore perfection to the world through peace and participation

<li>The Covenant unites Jewish people with a sense of identity - all share common beliefs, practises and laws. Circumcision is a sign of accepting and ratifying the covenant (Brit Milah)

<li>Prophetic vision refers to an experience where an individual, item or event appears vividly within the mind, being under the influence of the divine or another agency

<li>In the context of Judaism, God called prophets who walked the earth to communicate God's message to the Jewish people

<li>A prophet's main goal is to ensure that the covenant is maintained and protected, through administering God's direct messages to all

<li>Tikkun Olam refers to 'repair the world', which is a social justice principle. The need for social justice is a strong theme within the books of the prophets. For example, “trample on the heads of the poor and deny justice to the oppressed.” (Amos 2:7).

<li>Social justice is present across all Jewish variants, being one of the 613 Mitzvot. Tikkun Olam itself illustrates a system of vales that guide adherents' actions with the world

<ul>


<li>For example, Jews are called to be stewards of God's creation. They should cultivate His work through deeds of loving kindness (Gemilut Chasadim)

<li>"See to it that you do not spoil and destroy my world, for if you do there will be no one else to repair it" (Ecclesiastes 7:13)
