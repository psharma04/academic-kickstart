<ul>

<li>Jesus was did not seek to establish a new religion - he wanted to reform the ways of the Jewish people, which had become contrary to God's teaching
<ul>

<li>He was acting as a prophet in the eyes of Jewish people
</li>
</ul>

<li>Jesus preached regarding the nature and reign of God and the values worldly humans should show - peace, love and cooperation
<ul>

<li>Opposed depictions of God in eyes of Jewish people, who thought He was fierce and mean
</li>
</ul>

<li>Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth. He travelled to Galilee, where He was baptised by John the Baptist, His cousin

<li>Jesus made the power of God known through preaching and healing, documented in all four Gospels

<li>Jesus challenged the material world by demonstrating love and peace to all, causing the marginalised outcasts to follow Him after being rejected by the Jewish people
<ul>

<li>"How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?" (Jn 4:5). Jesus challenged the class-system of the time

<li>“do you begrudge my generosity?” (Mt 20:15).  He preached values of generosity and love to all people
</li>
</ul>

<li>Jesus' ministry concluded in Jerusalem, where He celebrated the Passover, was arrested and crucified
<ul>

<li>He was placed in a tomb and resurrected 3 days later. He appeared to his disciples, commissioned them and ascended to heaven
</li>
</ul>

<li>Christians view Jesus as a model for life who shows the perfect way to love God and everyone else. His way of living documented through the Gospels demonstrates the way in which all Christian adherents should strive to live
<ul>

<li>Jesus offers a direct link to God due to His Divinity and His teachings
</li>
</ul>

<li>Jesus's values provide a guide for Christian adherents, even 2000 years later:
<ul>

<li>As he showed compassion to the poor, healed the sick and taught the love of God. He is showing how to live a life that Christians should follow.

<li>He is an idea, a philosopher or a teacher of values, wisdom who calls Christians to a radically personal relationship with God.

<li>Calls his followers to conversion and discipleship that involve sacrifice and suffering.

<li>This portrayal of Jesus helped provide framework for the beliefs, rituals, and behaviour for the whole life journey of the Christian.

<ul>

<li>33-70 CE (Initial Wave) - begins with Pentecost after Jesus' death. Disciples were filled with Holy Spirit and were commissioned by Jesus to go out into the world and 'make disciples of all nations' (Matthew 28:19)
<ul>

<li>Peter became the leader of the Church.

<li>Christianity remains a sect of Judaism - adherents follow Mosaic Law and the teachings based on Hebrew Scripture, however, they celebrate the Eucharist and Baptism

<li>There was little formal activity in this period, as all believed that Christ's second coming was soon
</li>
</ul>

<li>49 CE (Council of Jerusalem) - Christians were made to abandon all pagan beliefs and follow the decalogue + Jesus' teachings
<ul>

<li>Christianity was opened to the wider world, and all people could join if they renounced pagan ways and joined Christ

<li>The mass following this attracted was a catalyst for the separation from Judaism

<li>The destruction of the Jewish Temple as a result of the failed Jewish Revolt against Romans (66-73 CE) led to mass migration from citizens living in Judea

<li>The growing numbers of followings made formalisation of the belief imminent, which led to Christianity's split from Judaism in 100 CE
</li>
</ul>

<li>64-313 CE (Persecution) - The Jewish people were angered with Christianity's split and were fearful of Roman punishments if Jesus' teachings continued to spread across the Roman Empire.
<ul>

<li>As a result, Christian people were persecuted by the Romans and the Jewish people. During this time, followings declined significantly

<li>Emperor Nero blamed the great fire of Rome (64 CE) on Christians. This signalled the beginning of the persecution, which lasted 2 centuries
</li>
</ul>

<li>313 CE (Edict of Milan) - Constantine granted the Edict of Milan, legalising the Christian religion within the Roman Empire and ordering the end of persecution. He issued this edict after emerging victorious out of battle after receiving a vision from God
<ul>

<li>The Nicene Creed was created at the council of Nicaea (325) which signalled the official beginning of Christianity

<li>In 380 CE, Emperor Theodosius issued the Edict of Thessalonica, which made Nicene Christianity the official religion of Rome and the state church of the Roman Empire

<ul>

<li>Athanasius (296-323 CE) proposed that Jesus was both fully human and fully divine. He had the same nature as God, but was also fully human

<li>The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) adopted these teachings, and the doctrine of the Holy Trinity was formed

<li>Holy Trinity - God is seen as one God of three distinct aspects - God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit

<li>The Holy Trinity is a concept beyond human nature - mere humans can not understand it. When Christians enter salvation, they believe that they will be able to understand this mystery of Faith
<ul>

<li>St Thomas Aquinas 'if you understand the Holy Trinity, you do not understand the Holy Trinity'
</li>
</ul>

<li>Christ is believed to be human, living at a certain time and having certain limitations (eg. experiencing pain, anger, fear). He is also the divine Son of God.

<li>Gospel accounts detail Jesus' arrest, taken to Golgotha and crucified. They state that this was the end of Jesus' earthly life

<li>However, it was not the end of His mission. After dying, Jesus rose from the dead and appeared to His followers (Matthew 28:1-15, Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-12, John 20:1-18)

<li>He then ascended into heaven and was raised into new life - entering a glorious and transformed state (Mark 1:6-19, Luke 24:50-53).

<li>Christian feast of the Ascension is celebrated 40 days after Easter

</ul>

<li>All Christians believe that, like Jesus, one day they too will have their body and soul transformed to share in the life of Jesus in Heaven (2 Cor 4:14, 1 Cor 15:35, 42-44)

<li>The death and resurrection is the foundation of the Christian religion, as demonstrated by Paul in his letter to the Corinthians " “If Christ has not been raised, then empty… is our preaching; empty, too, your faith” (1 Corinthians 15:14).

<li>Provides purposeful prayer and reflection and acts as a tool for this

<li>Aids domestic rituals, such as grace before meals

<ul>

<li>The ideals and goals of Christianity primarily dictate the actions of man, which should aim to demonstrate love and compassion to each other, even in times of hardship.

</li>
</ul>

<li>Christianity's ethical teachings are based on three main extracts from the Bible: the Decalogue, the Beatitudes and the Commandment of Love, which have endured time to guide adherents today.
<ul>

<p>

​     
<ul>

<li>Found in the Old Testament, the 10 Commandments were given by God to Moses atop Mt Sinai, documented in Exodus 20: 1-17.

<li>They are a set of rules and guidelines divided into two primary parts - the first three focus on the worship of God, whilst the remaining seven focus on relationships with others and their neighbour

<li>They should not be seen as chores or tasks or even punishments - they are given by God as a sign of His love.
<ul>

<li>The commandments do not seek perfection, but rather encourage to act in the way of Christ
</li>
</ul>

<li>Each commandment has many values associated with it, though not explicitly stated. 'Though shall not kill' shows values of trust, justice and honesty

<li>The commandments provide boundaries for Christian living and therefore act as a key foundation for ethical decision making

<ul>

<li>Jesus, through his Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5:1-12), gave the Beatitudes to His followers. They are declarations of praise that promote values of humility, meekness and hunger for righteousness

<li>Their purpose was to instruct adherents on virtues that should be lived out through their lives. They guide adherents to be conscious of the poor and those who suffer. Eg “Happy are those who work for peace; God will call them his children” (Mt 5:9)

<li> Luke's version of the Beatitudes detail poverty, hunger and desolation, promising rewards from God if action is taken. The Beatitudes are reinforced by threatening woes given by Jesus

<li>The social justice message of the Beatitudes is present in many biblical passages, such as the Good Samaritan or the Raising of the Widow's Husband, which demonstrates compassion and humility

<li>Seen in modern society through the work of charity organisations such as St Vincent de Paul or the Salvation Army

​     
<ul>

<li>Prayer does not change God - He does not gain anything out of prayer, but rather, our prayers demonstrate our relationship with God

<li>We pray because Jesus told us to; 'pray always'. We also pray for our own needs and to reassure oursleves that God is listening

<li>The primary goal of prayer is to strengthen the relationship one has with God. Prayer does not change God, but it changes people and it changes things

<li>Purposes for prayer
<ul>

<li>During suffering- personal or family/friends 🡪 gives hope

<li>During times of decision making 🡪 asking for advice/ guidance

<li>When grateful 🡪 give thanks and appreciation

<li>When one has sinned 🡪 asks for forgiveness
<p>

​     
<ul>

<li>Prayer varies for each denomination. For example, Catholics pray for the intercession of saints or Mary, while protestants pray directly to God

<li>Prayer provides opportunity for one to experience the mysteries of the Faith. It provides direction, a sense of community and joy. It encourages adherents to act in a more Christ like way to all people

    <strong>Notes:</strong>
<p>

​     
<ul>

<li>Contrary to popular belief, prayer is not just asking God to do something. There are 5 forms of prayer within the Christian Faith, expressed either vocally, mentally or in a contemplative manner

<li>Blessing (eg. Gloria, Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary)
<ul>

<li>Exalts the greatness of God and acknolwedges Him for His great deeds
</li>
</ul>

<li>Adoration (eg. Gloria, St Faustina Prayer, Glory Be)
<ul>

<li>Adherents adore the greatness of God and focus on God. They forget themselves and focus on what transcends their mundane world

<li>Adherents acknowledge the greatness of God and gain a deeper sense of communion with Him through appreciation of His power
</li>
</ul>

<li>Petition (eg. Penitential Rite, Agnus Dei)
<ul>

<li>Adherents ask God for things which they would like in their lives, both spiritual and physical needs

<li>Adherents may also choose to ask for forgiveness of their sins. However, they must be wary that God's will always triumphs
</li>
</ul>

<li>Intercession (eg. Prayers of the Faithful, Hail Mary)
<ul>

<li>Asking God to think about the needs of others, and not our own, either through asking God or the saints or Mary

<li>Prayers of intercession, "leads us to pray as Jesus did" (Article 2634 of the CCC)
</li>
</ul>

<li>Thanksgiving (eg. Grace before meals, Gloria and General Thanks)
<ul>

<li>Thanking God for what has already been done or what has been given to adherents through His power

<li>Many adherents often forget to say thank you to God - this accounts for minimal prayer times
</li>

   <td>Christian prayer can be divided into five main types. Blessing and adoration are prayers or praise, which acclaim God's glory and adore it. Petition and intercession are used to ask for things, whether it be for themselves or for others. Prayers of thanksgiving are used to thank God for what has been done or what has been given. Through engaging in these prayers, Christians feel closer to God.
