 Transcendent Religious Worldview

<ul>

<li>Beliefs in divine powers that exceed human limitations - the deity or the supernatural dimension is not on Earth, but beyond or above it

<li>Adherents turn to the divine and beyond the physical world as a way to escape the concerns of the material world

<li>Adherents, therefore, are able to focus their attention on heavenly matters, rather than the physical concerns of the natural world
<p>
 Immanent Religious Worldview

<ul>

<li>The divine powers and being are present within the natural world, or within humans themselves.
<ul>

<li>Especially made evident through adherents' daily activities and actions
</li>
</ul>

<li>The God or gods are present within, rather than above or beyond, the natural world. Adherents use each other or other aspects of the world to express their spirituality
<p>
 A Combination of Immanent and Transcendent Elements

<ul>

<li>Religions may have both religious and transcendent elements, or the whole religion can be firmly either transcendent or immanent

<li>For example, the different aspects of the religion may be either transcendent or immanent, or the God can exist in several forms, some of which are transcendent and some are immanent

<li>EG - CHRISTIANITY: the transcendent God, who can not be seen or held by humans, sent His only Son who was the immanent Him on the Earth.

<li>EG - JUDAISM: the transcendent God was incomprehensible to adherents, however, He held close relationships with Abraham and Moses, showing elements of immanence

A transcendent worldview refers to one in which the supernatural being is beyond the human world, an example of which is the Jewish God. An immanent religious worldview refers to the presence of the supernatural being in or within the world, an example is Jesus Christ, who walked the world. Religions may contain both transcendent and immanent elements.

<li>Dynamic, living religions are ones that stimulate change and constantly refresh themselves, in order to remain immersed in mundane activities and society

<li>Through the interactions between the four characteristics of religion, the Faith remains relevant to adherents and society. As a result, the characteristics are interdependent when forming the dynamic religion

<li>For example, believers read sacred texts to formulate their own interpretation of the religion. The sacred texts also inform ethical teachings and rituals and ceremonies, which believers use to express their Faith

<li>As adherents develop over time, their interpretation of the sacred texts change due to outside influences and personal preference, causing the beliefs and ethics formulated from them to vary between years.

<li>It is believed the universe already existed, and ancestral spirits began transforming it to create world order.

<li>The Dreaming and creation stories explain why things are the way they are, the way in which people should behave and the proceedings of sacred rituals

<ul>

<li>All land is sacred to Aboriginal people, however, particular sites hold greater significance to them than others
<ul>

<li>These are called sacred sites - often places where importance events happened or where ancestral beings reside
</li>
</ul>

<li>Rituals take place on these sacred sites, as they are believed to be places of sanctity for all Aboriginal people

<li>Different Aboriginal groups have different sacred sites, as each site corresponds with an event or happening that occurs during the Dreaming

<li>EG - ULURU - Uluru is one of the most famous Aboriginal sacred sites, however, Australian people do not always respect it
<ul>

<li>In a gesture of respect to Aboriginal elders, Uluru will no longer be able to be climbed as of October. However, many people wish for it to remain open for profit

<li>Aboriginal leaders, too, are often divided - some are supported financially by tourists and have interests in keeping the rock open. However, respect should be shown to traditional Aboriginal beliefs
</li>
</ul>

<li>Dreaming stories, whilst detailing creation, also function as the law (lore) of a particular tribe. They can also formulate an ethical system which is obeyed by all members of a particular tribe

   <td>Whilst all land is sacred to Aboriginal people, places where Ancestral beings reside or places of rituals are especially important and are given the name 'sacred site'. An example of one such site is Uluru. The Dreaming stories provide 'law' for the Aboriginal people - an ethical system obeyed by all people.

   <td>Kinship is shaped by the Dreaming and is a central concept to all Aboriginal people. It dictates a network of reciprocal obligations, inclusive of treatment of land, behaviour and the transmitting of the Dreaming from elder to child. Therefore, kinship dictates all aspects of Aboriginal life and ensures that the spirituality remains alive and refreshed.

<li>The land is 'impregnated with the power of ancestor spirits'

<li>The dreaming performs the following functions for Aboriginal people: how to make things, how to operate love music, a passport to the land, lives of ancestors, why the land looks like it does, ethical behaviour, rituals, food gathering and preparation, why the people exist and tribal responsibilities

<li>Aboriginal people have a way of life that is inclusive of all things - they are part of one, big family which includes the land itself

<li>No life is older than the land - therefore, the land should be treated with love and respect, as anyone would treat their family

<li>The carers of the family must look after the land. Everyone is part of the same family, so no one is ever lonely
