- ## Wave Properties

  - Vibrating objects transfer energy through waves
  - Waves are classified by what they move through
  - There are two types: mechanical and electromagnetic

  ### Mechanical Waves

  - Mechanical waves transfer energy through vibrations in a medium
  - Examples include water, sound and wind
  - A wave can be a single pulse, or continuous

  > Waves only transfer energy from one point to another. THEY DO NOT TRANSFER MATTER!
  > However, matter may move as the wave passes through it.

  - Mechanical waves can be either transverse or longitudinal.
    - In a transverse wave, particles oscillate (move back and forth) perpendicular (at 90Â°) to the direction of energy transfer.
    - In a longitudinal wave, particles move parallel to the direction of energy transfer.

  ### Measuring Mechanical Waves

  - Waves can be represented by displacement-distance graphs and displacement-time graphs.
  - The graph takes a sinusoidal shape (like a sine wave)
