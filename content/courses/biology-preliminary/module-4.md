Module 4 - Ecosystem Dynamics 
============================

**Population Dynamics**

**Inquiry Question: What effect can one species have on the other
species in a community?**

-   **Organisation within ecosystems**

    1.  Biosphere contains all the living thighs on Earth

> - Environments can positively or negatively impact an organism - An
> organism living and non-living surrounds its ecosystem

-   **Impact of Abiotic Factors**

    1.  Abiotic factors are not easily disturbed

- Own unique way of thriving within the limits of the abiotic
environment

- Water is a very effective filter of sunlight

- Rapid drop in temperature

- Oxygen levels

-   **Impact Of Biotic Factors**

    1.  Living organisms can affect each other by predation and
        symbiosis but also have an equally profound effect on resources

- Food sources, mates, light, nutrients, water

- Predation

- Predator obtains its food by killing and eating another animals

- Found in aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems

- Spider capturing bugs in its web and eating it

- Competition

> Competition is usually for a resource in the environment that is
> limited supply but valuable for survival
>
> - All competition involves risk to the competitors and the rewards
> must outweigh the inherent risk

- Intraspecific → Within a species

- Interspecific → Between species

- Symbiotic

> - Interactions in which two organisms live together in a close
> relationship that is beneficial to at least one of them

- Obligate relationship → species depend on each other to live

- Mutualism

- Both organism benefit

> - Clownfish and sea anemone → Clown fish is protected by the sea
> anemone whilst the fish cleans the plant

- Commensalism

- One species is benefited whilst the other is not harmed or helped

- Birds that live in hollow holes in trees

- Parasitism

- One species benefits whilst the other is harmed

> - Parasite obtains shelter from the host organism while feeding upon
> the tissue and fluids

-   **Ecological Niches occupied by Species**

    1.  The part of an ecosystem that the organism occupies is called a
        niche

- Refers to all the resources that a species uses, including biotic and
abiotic

- The process of having unique living strategies

> - Fundamental niche → The perfect conditions and resources for an
> organism to live and reproduce
>
> - Realised Niche → All the aspects of the ecosystem including the
> interactions of other species

-   **Consequences in ecosystems**

    1.  Predation

- Effect the distribution and abundance of prey

- If the prey can reproduce fast enough, rates wont drop

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image47.jpg)- Prey and predators are in direct
> proportion

- Competition

> - Effects reproduction and survival rates
>
> - More food sources → More abundance of both species
>
> - Different traits will boost a species survival of getting resources

- Symbiosis

- Increased evolutionary diversification

- Development of new species from the integration of genetic material

> More resilient ecosystems → Biodiversity

- Disease

> - Any process that adversely affects the normal functioning of tissue
> in a living organism

- Bacteria, virus, Pathogen

> - Alter the balance of food webs → Affected species will decline in
> numbers

-   **Recent Extinction**

-   Climate Change

    1.  Continent dried out

> - Rainforests were contracting -- stored moisture and returned
> moisture to the atmosphere.
>
> - Eucalypt forests replaced these, and water was not as efficiently
> retained.

- Became hotter and drier, fires broke out due to lightning.

> - Plants and animals that survived the drought and fire reproduced,
> changing the flora and fauna.

-   Arrival Of Humans

    1.  Aboriginal people arrived successful predators.

- Used 'fire stick' farming techniques.

> - Introduction of dingoes may have reduced the diversity of carnivore
> predators.

-   Level Of Nutrients

    1.  Low level of nutrients in the soil → dry

- Led to smaller animals →F can be sustained on less

> - Evidence for this can be seen in the smaller size of mammals in
> Australia compared to counterparts across the world.

**Past Ecosystems**

**Inquiry Question: How do selection pressures within an ecosystem
influence evolutionary change?**

-   **Past Ecosystems**

    1.  It is unclear when humans first became interested in fossils.

- Philosophers hinted that fossils were evidence of previous life.

- Law of superposition → oldest layer at bottom and newest at top.

-   **Aboriginal Rock Paintings**

    1.  Longest unbroken tradition in the world

- Humans are driven by nature to record details of their existence

- West Kimberly's rock paintings

- Radiometric dating is used to date the paintings

> - Uranium/Thorium can be used to underlying calcite formations to show
> when they were formed

- Types and abundance of animals depicted in paintings changed overtime

-   **Geological Evidence**

    1.  Allows reconstruction of timeline of events

- Represents the course of changes in geological and fossil deposits

- Banded iron Formations

- Form of geochemical evidence found in Australia

> - Earth\'s atmosphere has undergone changes, change from anaerobic to
> aerobic

- Form of iron rich and iron poor sediments

> - Prokaryotes lead to an increase in oxygen concentration in the
> ocean, leading to precipitation of insoluble iron oxide
>
> - Precipitate accumulated at the bottom of the ocean, forming an iron
> rich layer of sediments

- Great oxygenation event transformed Earth's atmosphere

> - Resulted in much larger and multicellular organism→ Organisms had to
> adapt to more oxygen

- Palaeontological Evidence

> - Fossils offer clues to the selection pressures of living things like
> the climate and environment at the time
>
> - Found in sedimentary rocks → Preserve evidence rather than
> destroying it
>
> - Fossilised soils contain large concentrations of carbon that
> indicate presence of life
>
> - Chemosynthesis is a process where organisms use inorganic compounds
> available from their environment.
>
> - The fossils formed from stromalites provide valuable informationof
> early orgaims and the environment in which they lived

-   **Ice Core Drilling**

    1.  Accumulation of ice layers in places such as antarctica leaves
        an annual record of gas and dust in that atmosphere of that time

> - Scientists can drill into the ice, extract gases and reconstruct the
> climate record

- Increases understanding of past environments

-   **Radiometric Dating**

    1.  Process where scientists determine the age in years of a fossil,
        rock or mineral

- Based off the content of radioactive isotopes

> - Unstable isotopes change to form stable isotopes → Undergoes
> radioactive decay which scientists can compare to examine the life of
> the rock

- More half lives → Older

> - Rate of decay is calculated using the *age*​ *equation* that
> compares the abundance of the naturally occurring isotope with the
> abundance of the decay product.

-   **Gas Analysis**

    1.  Scientists can use data in ice cores to reconstruct atmospheric
        concentrations of certain gases, particularly CO~2~​ and O~​~
        2.​

> - CO~2~​ is a normal part of Earth's atmosphere along with nitrogen,
> oxygen, argon and other trace gases
>
> - But CO~2~​ is also considered a 'greenhouse gas' that traps solar
> radiation keeping the Earth warm enough to sustain life
>
> - However, increasing CO~2~​ in atmosphere is likely to increase
> Earth's atmospheric temperature, known as the 'enhanced greenhouse
> effect' or 'global warming'
>
> - Scientists use ancient CO~2~​ levels~​~ to infer past climates -
> warming or cooling would have a direct effect on the types of plants
> and animals that are suited to survive in such a climate
>
> - Oxygen has three naturally occurring isotopes: ^16^​ ^​^O, ^17^​
> ^​^O and ^18^​ ^​^O which are incorporated into water molecules. The
> ratio of ^18^​ O/^​^​^16^ ^​^O in analysed ice core samples indicates
> ancient water temperatures which scientists can use to reconstruct
> water temperatures on Earth.

-   **Small Mammals**

    1.  We Can use fossil of past animals to show similarities and
        differences to present day animals and therefore propose
        evolutionary relationships between them.

> - When comparing the modern platypus to fossils, body shape became
> smaller + more simplified.

- We can infer a change in diet as dentition is different

- Habitat reduced in size → May have become vulnerable.

-   **Reasons for Change**

    1.  Australia's change in climate due to the split of Gondwana

- Climate change

- Arrival of indigenous

> - Introduction of non native plant + animals → invasive species →
> Destroys or affects the natural food web

**Future Ecosystems**

**Inquiry Question: How can human activity impact an ecosystem?**

-   **Human Induced Species**

    1.  Increasing Population

- Selective breeding, use of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides

> - Medical breakthroughs with antibiotics, better hygiene and
> vaccinations
>
> - Increasing populations of humans lead to an increase of the demand
> of resources from ecosystems
>
> - Selective breeding limits the biodiversity of species, hence making
> them more susceptible to being majorly effected by disease or change

- Agriculture

> - Removal of trees leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion → Loss of
> valuable minerals for an ecosystem

- Pollutions harms the water and atmosphere

- Irrigation was developed alongside the domestication of plants

> - Selective breeding of crops and livestock radically altered their
> features to favour large yields

- Introduced Species

> - Many invasive species out compete native species for light, water,
> habitats and nutrients
>
> - Change the environments to alter the microclimate of the areas to
> favour their own development
>
> - Completely alter the food web system which has detrimental effects
> on the rest of the ecosystem

- Land Clearing

> - Refers to the removal of native vegetation for urban and
> agricultural development
>
> - Removes nesting and habitats of native animals → Cannot reestablish
> anywhere else.

- Extinction

- Habitat loss is the leading cause of extinction

> - Most historic extinctions have occurred on islands because a small
> habitat loss has devastating effects
>
> - Extinction opened niches for surviving organism to expand into →
> Rapid development of species

-   **Past To Inform the Future**

    1.  Can estimate rates of extinction by studying recorded extinction
        events, examining fossil record and by analysing modern trends
        in habitat loss

> - Over exploitation of resources → Harvesting an amount that is not
> sustainable over time
>
> - Introduced species → New species effect relationships due to
> competition, predation and disease
>
> - Disruption of ecological relationships → loss of available niches
> alter the distribution and abundance of species

-   **Biodiversity**

    1.  Genetic diversity → Intraspecies diversity in traits that makes
        a population resilient to environmental changes

- Species Diversity → Variety of species in an ecosystem

> - Ecosystem diversity → Variety of ecosystems available in a broader
> area such a continents or globally

-   **Climate Change**

    1.  Greenhouse Effect

- Solar radiation reaches and penetrates earths atmosphere

- Some energy is trapped and absorbed into the land and ocean

- Keeps earth warm and sustainable

- Enhanced Greenhouse

- Increase of concentration of greenhouse gases

- More energy being absorbed in oceans and land

- Warmer climate

- External factors → Solar input from the sun, Earths variety in orbit

> - Internal factors → Active release of CO2 from volcanoes, diffusion
> of CO2 from ocean, less reflection of light from ice (Melting ice is
> bad)

- Human Factors → burning fossil fuels, agriculture, land clearing

-   **Models Predicting Biodiversity**

    1.  Resources increase slow

- Humans grow quick

- Humans will outgrow their ability to feed themselves

- Greater fertility will lead to starvation

- Keep numbers and population in check

-   **Mining Sites**

    1.  Required to follow laws and strict guidelines, which include
        submitting information on how they intended to ensure minimal
        harm to environment

> - All mining companies must complete an environmental impact statement
> as a part of their license application

-   **Land Degradation and Agriculture**

    1.  Marked improvement in the management of Australiansoils and
        waterways

- Farm owners can have their land inspected by scientists

- Management of salinity and erosion are high priorities

- Biological controls are being used to maintain pests
