**Organisation Of Cells**

**Inquiry Question- How are cells arranged in a multicellular organism?**

-   **Unicellular Organisms (Bacteria)**

    1.  Contain one cell, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic

- First forms of life

> - A single cell carries out all life processes → obtaining nutrients,
> exchanging gas, removing waste and reproduction
>
> - High SA:V ratio which allows for more efficient movement of
> substances - Requires a moist environments for diffusion and osmosis
> to occur

-   **Colonial Organisms (Volvox)**

    1.  A group of cells working or organism working collectively is
        called a colony

- May be unicellular or multicellular

> - Can exist independently, however in a multicellular organism
> colonial organisms cannot exist alone.

-   **Multicellular Organisms**

    1.  A community of cells working together to enable the organism to
        carry out life processes, including reproduction.

> - Composed of many different specialised cells, Similar cells are
> grouped together and perform specific functions that combine for the
> efficient functioning for the organism - Consists of eukaryotic cells.

- Large organisms made up of smaller cells increases SA:V ratio.

- Each specialised cell type is structurally suited to a particular
function.

> - Embryonic cells develop suitable structural changes to best suit
> their function → Red blood cell

-   **FORMATION OF SPECIALISED CELLS**

    1.  When cells become specialised they differentiate -- they develop
        structures enabling them to carry out their function, making
        them different to other cells.

> - Specialised cells originate from stem cells, which are
> undifferentiated cells with the ability to divide repeatedly.
>
> - [Cell specialisation refers to the function of the cell, while
> differentiation is the]  [process of a stem cell goes through to
> become specialised.] 

- Enables organisms to grow larger while still efficiently carrying out
processes.

> - Specialised cells cannot survive independently -- they rely on other
> cells in the organisms to carry out functions they cannot.

- Communication between cells is vital.

> - In animals this is via the bloodstream and nervous system whereas in
> the plants it is brought about by chemical and physical contact
> between cells.

-   **Cell Hierarchy**

    1.  Organelle Cell Tissue Organ Organ System Organism

> - Mitochondria Cardiac Muscle Cell Cardiac Muscle Tissue Heart
> Cardiovascular System Human

-   **Animal Tissues**

    1.  Epithelial Tissue

- Covers body surfaces, protects organs and forms glands.

- Densely packed cells in single sheets or layers.

- Doesn't contain blood vessels.

> 2 distinct surfaces -- exposed to the exterior body cavity or
> exposed to adjacent tissue.

- Some are specialised for absorption or secretion.

- Connective Tissue

> - Provides support, ensures that all body parts are bound together and
> protects against damage
>
> - Fibrous connective tissue, loose connective tissue, adipose tissue,
> cartilage and bone → Differences are from the arrangement of cells and
> specialised structure.

- Collagen (strength) + Elastin (Flexibility)

- Nervous Tissue

- Comprises brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves.

- Highly specialised for communication between all parts of the body

> - Highly specialised of passing messages between themselves and other
> cells

- Muscle Tissue

- Muscle cells are highly specialized for contraction

- Skeletal, Smooth, Cardiac

> - Responsible for the movement of the body and particular contractions
> in various processes (oesophagus peristalsis)

-   **Plant Tissues**

    1.  Meristematic Tissue

- Tips of roots and shoots

- Cells divide to produce new growth

- Site of cell differentiation

-

- Dermal Tissue

> - Protects plant tissue and is found in outer layers of stems, roots
> and leaves.
>
> - Epidermal layer is the outmost, secreting a waxy layer called
> cuticle, vital to reduce water loss

- Lack Chloroplasts

- Vascular Tissue

- Responsible for the transport of substances around the plant

- Xylem transports water and minerals from the roots to the leaves

- Phloem transports products of photosynthesis around the plant

- Ground Tissue

- Internal cells of a plant other than the vascular

- Specialised for storage, support and photosynthesis

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image28.jpg)

**Nutrient and Gas Requirements**

**Inquiry Question: What is the difference in nutrient and gas
requirements between autotrophs and heterotrophs?**

-   **Autotrophs**

    1.  Produce their own organic compounds and energy from inorganic
        compounds from their environment, such as carbon dioxide and
        water.

- Can be divided into two groups:

- Photoautotrophs -- use light energy (e.g. green plants).

> - Chemoautotrophs -- use chemical energy (e.g. nitrifying bacteria in
> the soil)

-   **Heterotrophs**

    1.  Obtain organic compounds from obtaining other organism

- Include all animals and fungi

-   **Vascular and Nonvascular Plants**

    1.  Majority of autotrophic organisms are plants.

> - Vascular plants possess a transport system to move substances from
> one part of the plant to another.

- Plants have specialised cells grouped into tissues

> - These tissues work collaboratively to carry out life processes like
> photosynthesis and gas exchange.
>
> - A small number of plants are called non-vascular because they do not
> possess this transport system (e.g. mosses and liverworts). - Have a
> very simple structure.
>
> - All nutrients are absorbed, and wastes are removed by diffusion and
> osmosis through the surfaces of the plant.

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image29.jpg)

-   **Root System**

    1.  Usually underground.

> - The main function of anchoring the plant and absorbing water and
> inorganic nutrients from the soil.

- Very large surface area.

> - Absorption occurs through specialised epidermal cells in the
> outermost layer of the root.

- Increased surface area achieved in the following ways:

- Extensive branching (also provides good anchorage)

> - Root hair zone located in the younger part of each root -- epidermal
> cells protrude outwards into the surrounding soil, as microscopic
> extensions called root hairs.

- Flattened epidermal cells increase the exposed surface.

- Water moves via osmosis.

> - Mineral ions usually move via diffusion -- if diffusion is too slow,
> facilitated diffusion and active transport may be involved.
>
> - Root cells have no chloroplasts and thus cannot photosynthesise, but
> they can carry out respiration

-   **Shoot System (Stem)**

    1.  Provides structural support and a transport pathway

- Located above ground

- Consists of 3 main functions

- Dermal→ Waterproofing, protection, gas exchange

> - Vascular → Composed of the xylem and the phloem within vascular
> bundles

- Ground Tissue → Fills in around vascular tissue

-   **Shoot System (Leaves)**

    1.  Located above ground

> - Main function is to absorb sunlight and carbon dioxide and produce
> glucose through the process of *photosynthesis.*​
>
> - Leaves are adapted to absorb the maximum amount of sunlight possible
> to provide the energy needed to break bonds in water during the first
> stage of photosynthesis.
>
> - Thin, flat structure of leaves is well suited to this function -- no
> internal cell is too far from the light.

- Large SA allows maximum absorption.

> - Transparent epidermis allows sunlight to penetrate the
> photosynthetic cells beneath.

- *Mesophyll*​ is responsible for most of the plant\'s photosynthesis.

-   **Palisade Cells:** Dense with chloroplasts and are main
    > photosynthetic cells, situated vertically, large numbers ensure
    > maximum rate of photosynthesis.

-   **Spongy Mesophyll Cells:** Irregular in shape and distribution,
    > situated between palisade cells and lower epidermis, fewer
    > chloroplasts.

    1.  Leaves are also the site of *transpiration,*​ ​which is a
        process by which water evaporates from the leaf and aids the
        movement of water from the roots to the leaves and cools the
        plant.

> - The structure of a leaf allows it to carry out these functions in an
> efficient and effective manner.

- Sizes and shapes of leaves vary immensely.

- Plants in hot, dry habitats have:

> - Waxy Cuticles -- reduce the amount of water lost through
> evaporation. - Small Leaves -- minimal surface area to reduce water
> loss.

- Rainforest Plants have:

- Large, Thin, Flat Leaves -- absorb as much sunlight as possible.

- Less concern about water loss due to high humidity.

- Gaseous Exchange:

- Epidermis covers the surface of leaves.

> - Epidermal cells protect the inner tissues and are able to secrete a
> waterproof cuticle to prevent evaporation of water.
>
> - Epidermal cells are transparent to allow light to pass to the cell
> layers beneath.
>
> - Guard Cells -- control exchange of gases and the loss of water
> through leaves, occur in pairs surrounding the *stoma*​.

-   **Transport**

- Main transport tissues are the xylem and phloem in the centre of the
root

- The main vein in the leaf, the midrib, and many smaller veins branch
out from

> it
>
> - Distribution of vascular tissue around the plant ensures that all
> cells are getting the energy required to function.

-   **Cellular Respiration in Plants**

    1.  Plants carry out cellular respiration as well as photosynthesis

- Occur during night and day

- Oxygen and CO2 enter and exit the plant via the guard cells

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image31.jpg)

-

-   **Nutrient Requirements in Plants**

    1.  Carbon Dioxide

> - The opening and closing of the stomata has the greatest effect on
> carbon dioxide concentration in the leaf.
>
> - If the stomata is closed, available carbon dioxide is used up and
> the rate of photosynthesis is reduced.

- Water

> - Amount of water needed for photosynthesis is small compared to that
> needed for survival.
>
> - When water availability level is low, stomata close and reduce the
> amount of carbon dioxide entering the leaf, reducing the rate of
> photosynthesis.

- Light Energy

> - The greater the light intensity the faster the rate of
> photosynthesis until a plateau is reached.
>
> - The plateau is where all photosynthesis systems and enzymes are
> working at optimum rate.

-   **Imaging Technologies + Tracing Products Of Photosynthesis**

> - MRI→ uses radio waves and magnetic field to take a series of images
> of the plant structures that are used to produce a 3D image of the
> structure

- X-Ray→ Reveals deeper knowledge of the internal structure of the plant

> - Radioisotopes are used to determine whether the oxygen released
> during photosynthesis originated from the oxygen atom in water or
> carbon dioxide
>
> - Carbon-14 is added to the carbon dioxide supply of a plant → The
> carbon-14 then takes part in the reactions of photosynthesis and is
> incorporated into the glucose molecules

- The radioisotopes can be traced by the radiation they emit

-   **Gas Exchange in Plants**

- Leaves are adapted for gas exchange.

- Large and flat -- large SAV ratio.

> - Spongy mesophyll layer increases surface area and allow gases to
> move freely within the leaf.

- Surface of cell is moist

- Occurs through stomata and the lenticels.

- Stomata:

- Found on the underside of the leaf.

- Occasionally found on the upper epidermis.

- Both sides of the stomata are the guard cells.

> - These bean-shaped cells contain chloroplasts (unlike other epidermal
> cells)

- The inner wall of each guard cell is thicker than the outer wall.

- Stomata open and close when the guard cells gain or lose water.

- Lenticels:

- Pores through which gaseous exchange happens in woody plants

- Found on trunks and branches of trees and woody shrubs

> - Appear as small dots, but under the microscope they are seen as
> clusters of loose cells in the cork layer

- Diffusion through lenticels is relatively slow

-   **Gas Exchange in Animals**

- Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration

> - Carbon Dioxide must be removed as it is highly toxic in large
> concentrations - Mammals have lungs, fish have gills and insects have
> tracheal system - Large surface area enhanced by folding, branching or
> flattening.

- Moist, thin surfaces so that gasses can dissolve and diffuse.

- Close proximity to the transport system so gases can move easily.

- Maintenance of a concentration gradient.

-   Lungs

    1.  Gas exchange structures → alveoli

- Increased surface area -- folded

- Thin lining -- flattened single layer of cells

- Moist surfaces -- saturated with water vapour and mucus

> - Shares a membrane with the capillaries, hence this facilitates
> diffusion of gasses

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image32.jpg)

-   Gills

    1.  Gills extract the most oxygen possible out of water

- As the water passes through the gills oxygen diffuses into the fish

> - This is undertaken by a countercurrent process, this ensures the
> most oxygen is being diffused from the water (furthest away from
> equilibrium).
>
> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image33.jpg)

-   Tracheal System

    1.  Insects obtain and release air through spiracles

- Do not have lungs or capillaries

- Branching air tubes are called tracheal tubes

> Oxygen dissolves in fluid, this can be diffused into the cells and
> carbon dioxide diffuses out.

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image34.jpg)

-   **Human Digestive System**
1.  Mouth

- Teeth break down food for more efficient action of enzymes

- Salivary amylase is release and mixed by the tongue

- Tongue forms a bolus

- Oesophagus

- Peristalsis is the muscular contraction that forces food down

- Food is moved toward the stomach

- Stomach

- Gastric juices contain water, HCL and pepsin

- Contractions of muscles is a form of mechanical digestion

- pH → 2.0-3.0

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image35.jpg)- Breaks down larger and complex
> proteins to a obtainable level

- Small Intestine

- Emulsifies fats into smaller droplets

- Move by diffusion and osmosis

> - Villi increases the surface area for absorption
>
> - Lacteals are collected by the lymphatic system
>
> - Glucose and amino acids are absorbed into the capillaries

- Liver

- Duodenum

-   Neutralise the acidic chyme leaving the stomach and break down food

- Jejunum

-   Breaks down food into smaller pieces

-   Breaks down lipids into fatty acids

- Ileum

-   Absorption of products are moved by diffusion or active transport
    through villi

> Large intestine

- Undigested material moves to the large intestine

- Site of water and salt absorption

- Remaining faeces is moved to the rectum and anus via peristalsis

**Transport**

**Inquiry Question: How does the composition of the transport medium
change as it moves around an organism?**

-   **Transport System in Plants**

> - Involves vascular tissue arranged in vascular bundles made up of the
> phloem and xylem

- Xylem

- Moves upwards from the root

- Movement upwards from the root.

- Consists of xylem tracheids and xylem vessels.

> - *Tracheids:* ​long structures with tapered end walls in contact with
> each other.

- Xylem vessels are continuous tubes for the transport of water.

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image36.png)- Walls of vessels and tracheids are lined with lignin
> -- helps prevent the collapse of the vessel and easy movement of
> water.

- Fibres provide support.

- Phloem

> - Carries products of photosynthesis - Sieve tube cells and companion
> cells.
>
> - Sieve tube cells are long thin phloem cells with large pores through
> their end cell walls.

- These perforated cell walls are called sieve plates

> - Sieve tube cells possess mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, but
> no nuclei or other organelles

- They are arranged end to end forming sieve tubes

> - Sieve tube cells share cytoplasm, their sieve tubes form channels
> through which sugars and other plant products can flow - Companion
> cells are found alongside sieve tubes.
>
> - They have a nucleus and other organelles that are lacking in sieve
> tubes.
>
> - Companion cell function is uncertain, but they are thought to assist
> effectiveness of sieve tube elements by providing ATP.

- They also help with loading and unloading of sugars into a sieve tube.

-   **Transpiration-Cohesion-Tension Theory**

    1.  Transportation → Process of water vapour leaving the leaves via
        the stoma

> - Cohesion → Water is attracted to itself as it is a polar molecule:
> Hydrogen + Oxygen molecules.
>
> Adhesion → Water sticks to the walls of the xylem (Narrow xylem is
> more beneficial)

- Positive root pressure in the roots via osmosis

- Tensions is created by the pull from the leaves

-   **Source-Sink Theory**

    1.  Glucose produced in the leaf during photosynthesis is either
        stored as starch or converted to sucrose and distributed to all
        parts of the plant

- Distribution is called translocation and occurs in the phloem

> - Substances in the phloem move in whichever direction is required. -
> The phloem also carries amino acids and some mineral nutrients -
> Sucrose makes up approx. 90% of phloem sap.
>
> - Once it reaches cells is it converted to glucose for respiration or
> stored as starch
>
> - The movement is driven by the formation of high- and low-pressure
> regions within the phloem

- Movement occurs from high to low pressure

> - High-pressure occurs where the sucrose is produced (the source) and
> low-pressure occurs where the sucrose is required (the sink)
>
> - [The xylem and phloem are adjacent, hence during this process the
> water]  [from the xylem is diffused into the phloem to dilute the
> sugar.]  - Actively transported into stem and root cells for
> growth.

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image37.jpg)

-   **Transport System in Animals**

    1.  Open circulation

- Found in invertebrates such as insects

> Contains one or more hearts that contract to push blood fluid

- Hemolymph bathes organs and tissues

- Blood and interstitial fluid cannot be distinguished

- Blood is in direct contact with tissue

- Less efficient, low pressure, Slow

- Volume of blood cannot be controlled

- Closed Circulation

- Found in all vertebrates like fish, mammals frogs and reptiles

> - Contains blood that is enclosed by blood vessels with a driving
> force of the heart

- Pathway is from the heart, around the body and back to the heart

> - Transport nutrients and oxygen to the cells as well as returning
> waste and Carbon Dioxide

- BLood is not in direct contact with tissue

- Heart has 4 chambers to divide oxygenated and deoxygenated blood

- Pumped blood can be controlled by contractions and valves

- Lymphatic System

> - Transports excess fluid back into the cardiovascular system and is
> made up of lymph vessels and lymph.

- Maintains homeostasis

- Lymph → Watery fluid

- The Heart

> - Vene Cana → Right Atrium → Right Ventricle → Pulmonary Artery →
> Lungs → Pulmonary vein → Left Atrium → Left Ventricle → Aorta

- Composed of cardiac muscle cells

- Responsible for pumping blood around the body

- Pulmonary circulation is blood travelling from heart to lungs

> - Systemic Circulation is the process of pumping the blood around the
> body and back to the heart

-   **Structure of Blood Vessels**

    1.  Each vessel is best structured to suit the function of the
        vessel

- Artery

> - Thicker walls and narrow cross section as blood enters under high
> pressure, and thicker walls minimise the chance of the artery tearing.

- Walls also are more elastic, so it can expand and contract.

- Carries blood from the heart.

- Contraction squeezes blood forward and propels it along.

- Vein

- Thinner walls and wider lumen as the blood is not as high pressure.

> - The walls are not as elastic as the veins do not need to contract
> and expand as much as the arteries.

- Returns blood to the heart.

- Cross section is wider to allow easy flow of blood.

> - Blood is propelled by the contracting of muscles surrounding the
> veins.

- Valves situated at regular intervals to stop the reverse flow of
blood.

- Capillaries

> Walls are one cell layer thick so that substances can be diffused
> efficiently.
>
> - Brings blood into close contact with the tissues, enabling exchange
> of chemical substances between cells and the bloodstream.
>
> - Red blood cells pass through in a single file, increasing their
> exposed surface area for the exchange of gases, nutrients and waste.

-   **Blood As a Transport Medium**

    1.  Red Blood cells (Erythrocytes) - Transport oxygen.

- Form in bone marrow.

- Haemoglobin (oxygen carrier) is developed within the cell.

> - Round, biconcave and slightly flattened towards the centre -- more
> SA:V and elastic in order to squeeze through capillaries.
>
> - No nucleus so it has more hemoglobin for oxygen → Structure for
> function
>
> - White Blood Cells (Leukocytes) - Also produced in bone marrow.

- Part of the immune system.

- Role is to defend the body against foreign bodies.

- Found in tissues as well as the blood.

> - Can pass through capillaries by squeezing between the cells that
> make up the wall of the capillary.

- Larger than red blood cells.

- Not as abundant as red blood cells.

- All white blood cells have a nucleus.

- Platelets (Themocytes)

- Function in the clotting of blood.

> - Contact between fibres and platelets causes platelets to break open
> and release an enzyme, thromboplastin, which sets in progress a
> sequence of steps to seal the blood vessels and cause blood to clot.

- Crescent shaped.

- Half the size of red blood cells.

- Plasma

- Yellow, watery fluid.

- 90% water, 10% protein

> - Makes up the majority of the volume of blood and carries many
> substances throughout the body:

-   Proteins

-   Nutrients

-   Gases

-   Excretory Waste Products

-   Ions

-   Hormones

-   Vitamins

-   **Changes in Compositions Of Blood**

- Lungs

> As blood moves through the lungs it gains oxygen and loses carbon
> dioxide.

- Digestive System

- Increase in digestive end products.

- Lymphatic System

- Gain fatty acids that have been emptied into the bloodstream.

- Heart

- High lipid content.

- Stomach

- Water and other substances are diffused into the blood.

- Liver

- Decrease in digestive end products. 

- Glucose may be added or
removed.

- Urea is added to the blood.

- Toxins such as alcohol are removed.

- Some vitamins and iron are removed.

- Kidneys

- Urea is decreased.

- Excess water and salts are removed.

- Large Intestines

- Water, salts and vitamins are absorbed into the blood.

- Endocrine Glands - Hormones are added.
