## **Effects of the Environment On Organisms**

**Inquiry Question: How do environmental pressures promote a change in
species diversity and abundance?**

-   **Ecosystems**

>  Combination of all the organisms, biotic and abiotic, living in
> a community and how they interact

- Organisms with favorable characteristics/adaptations that are
uniquely suited for that ecosystem will ultimately survive better

- Diversity and abundance is due to variation in biotic and abiotic
factors

- Environment refers to the surroundings or dwelling place of all
living things → habitat or setting

- Abiotic factors directly influence selection pressures on organisms

- Terrestrial

- Found on land

- Dessert, grasslands, forest, Woodland

- Aquatic

- Wetlands, Mangrove swamps, estuaries, rivers, lakes

- Salt concentration, light availability

-   **Selection Pressures in an Ecosystem**

    1.  Selection pressures are all the factors of an ecosystem that
        influences changes of survival

- **Natural selection** is a process whereby species which have traits
that enable them to adapt in an environment survive and reproduce, and
then pass on their genes to the next generation.

- Drives natural selection

- Those individuals within the population that have random variations
that make them better suited to survive in the changed environment are
more likely to survive

- Genetic based variation are passed from presurvung parents to
offspring

- Biodiversity is essential for a surviving population → If all
organisms were the same, no organisms could adapt to new conditions. -
Abiotic pressures:

- Temperature

- Light intensity

- Pressure

- Salt concentration

- Water availability

- Biotic Factors

- Competition

- Prey Availability

- Predation

-   **Abundance and Distribution**

    1.  Abundance → How many individuals of that species live throughout
        an ecosystem

**-** Distribution **→**​ Where it is found​

- Both abiotic and biotic factors affect these

-   **Ecology**

    1.  The study of interrelationships between different types of
        organisms and between organisms and their environment.

- Determines the distribution and abundance of flora and fauna

- Determines measures of populations in areas

- Studies the patterns that are formed → Increase or decrease in
population

- What factors influence the distribution and abundance of populations
in ecosystems?

-   **Measuring Plant Abundance**

    1.  Non mobile organism are easier to collect data about

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image39.jpg)

> 120 daises have been collect in 10 1mx1m quadrats. What is the
> estimated abundance of daises in that area

- (120/1x10) x 800

-   **Measuring Animal Abundance**

    1.  Mark, Release, Capture

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image40.jpg)

> - First sample, 20 individuals were marked. Second sample 50 were
> collected, 10 were marked.

- (20x50/10)

-   **Population Trends**

    1.  Examining population trends can lead to inferences about the
        species and what abiotic and biotic characteristics they are
        most suited too.

-   **Changes in Populations Over Time**

    1.  Members in population that survive and reproduce in their
        habitat carry the traits most suitable for the conditions

- Cane Toads

> - Introduced to Australia in 1935 to control the greyback cane beetle
> in sugar plantations

- Increasing at a fast rate

- Specific structural adaptations and behaviours to suit Australia

-   Feed at night, no predators, breed all year, absorb water through
    
    > skin.

- The Cane Toads are evolving to be faster, but more prone to arthritis

> - Predators have increased resistance to the toxin and those reluctant
> to eat cane toads are ones that survive and reproduce
>
> - Red Belly Black snakes have gotten smaller due to the inability to
> consume the frogs → Snakes big enough to eat them die due to the toxin
>
> - The Northern Quoll has developed a Toad aversion mechanism to avoid
> the consumption of the toads

1.  Prickly Pear

- Introduced to Australia to start cochineal dye industry

> - Due to the lack of environmental pressures prickly pears spread at a
> rapid rate
>
> - Nonetheless, due to the lack of biodiversity, introducing a moth
> provided a strong selection pressure that quickly reduced the numbers
> and distribution of the prickly pears.

**Adaptations**

**Inquiry Question: How do adaptations increase the organism's ability
to survive?**

-   **Adaptations**

    1.  Organisms are adapted to survive in their natural environment as
        a result of evolutionary change by natural selection

> - An adaptation is a characteristic that an organism has inherited and
> makes it suited for its environment
>
> - It is a result of change that arise via mutation, when a cell
> divides and replicates during the process of reproduction

- Structural Adaptation

- How an organism is built

- Physiological

- How an organism functions

- Behavioural

- How an organism acts and behaves

-   **Structural Adaptation- Plants**

    1.  Desert plants are able to balance photosynthesis and water for
        cooling purposes without risking dehydration

> - Xenophytes → Structural adaptations to maximise absorption and
> storage or water and minimal loss of water
>
> - Eucalypts → Waxy leaves to minimise transpiration of water and
> exposure to sunlight

- Cypress Pines → Tiny cylindrical leaves to have a small SA:V ratio

-   **Structural Adaptations- Animals**

    1.  Thorny Devil

> - Has spikes on its body to make it look more ferocious as well as
> being harder to swallow by prey

- Has scales that absorb water straight into its mouth

- Gold and brown camouflages in dessert

- Wombat

> - Muscular shoulders and large claws used for extensive digging -
> Pouch to protect joeys from dirt whilst digging

-   **Physiological Adaptations- Plant**

    1.  Salt tolerant plants are able to maintain metabolic functioning
        through their cells accumulate sodium and chloride ions

- Minimise salt toxicity by increasing water content in vacuole

-   **Physiological Adaptations- Animal**

    1.  Penguins, seals and polar bears convert a lot of their diet to a
        fat layer to insulate them from the cold

> - Some animals slow down their metabolic rates so their overall
> temperature is cooled

- Cane toads dig a water tight mucus cocoon for cooling

-   **Behavioural Adaptations- Plant**

    1.  The venus flytrap has adapted to live in nitrogen-poor soils
        which it obtains via insects

> It can act rapidly when it detects an insect

- Insect becomes trapped and the plant absorbs its nutrients

-   **Behavioural Adaptations- Animal**

    1.  Puffer fish pumping air into their stomachs and blow up twice
        their size to frighten predators

- Penguins route in packs to reduce time spent in the cold

-   **Darwin in the Galapagos Islands**

    1.  Dariwn observed small ground finches on the Galapagos Islands

- The shape of their beak was observed → Size of beaks differed

- Naturally occurring changes in colour, beak size and leg length

> - Depending on which island they lived on, and the conditions they
> found themselves in, some birds thrive and reproduced - Charles Noted:

- There is a variation in all populations with many variation heritable

- There are more organisms born then the environment can sustain

- Those individuals that have more suitable characteristics survive

- Survivors pass on traits to offspring

> - Favorable traits will become more numerous if the environment is
> stable

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image41.jpg)

-   **Survival of the Fittest**

    1.  Variation exists with more population

- More offspring are produced that can survive

- The offspring better adapted will survive and reproduce

- The favourable characteristics are passed on

- Overtime favourable characteristics will increase in the population

**Theory Of Natural Selection**

**Inquiry Question: What is the relationship between biodiversity and
evolution?**

-   **The Theory Of Evolution By Natural Selection**

> Diversity allows adaptations to change in an environment

1.  Species have been developing for billions of years

- All theories of evolution share a common basic premises

> - Living organisms arose from common ancestors or a common life form
> and have changed over time
>
> - Differences that occur among groups of living organisms imply that
> living things change over time
>
> - Similarities occur in living things and suggest a common ancestry;
> the basic chemistry, inherited from a common life form, has remained
> relatively unchanged and has been passed down through generations.

-   **Biological Diversity**

    1.  The variety of forms of life on Earth, the diversity of the
        characteristics of living organisms and the variety of their
        ecosystems.

- Diversity allows for adaptations

- Three levels of biodiversity

- Genetic → Genetic makeup in a species

- Species → Measure of the diversity of species

- Ecosystem → Variation of different ecosystems

-   **Genetic Diversity**

    1.  Important for the population to be able to adapt

> - Environments are constantly changing and pose selection pressures
> that enable some organisms with favourable characteristics to survive
> and reproduce
>
> - No variation in the population will be more detrimental for an
> invasive organism or pressure

- More genetic diversity = more chance of survival

-   **Concept of Natural Selection**

    1.  Organisms must possess traits that favor their survival in that
        environment

> - [Variability] → All populations have random differences
> or variations among members

- [Heritability] → Variation must be inherited​

> - [Over Reproduction] →​ Organisms produce more offspring than
> what the ecosystem can sustain

- [Competition] → The best suited traits will ultimately thrive and
reproduce​

> - If there is a sudden change in the environments, those individuals
> that randomly possess a variation that is an advantage are more likely
> to survive the changed conditions

-   **Diversification of Life on Earth**

    1.  The move form unicellular organisms to multicellular organs
        began when these cells clustered together

> Life began to diversify further with a rise in invertebrates to fish
> and amphibians

- Followed by the dominance of reptiles

- Mammals species then began to dominate

- Selection pressures lead to the thrive and extinction of species

-   **Microevolution vs Macroevolution**

    1.  Macroevolution → Takes place over millions of years, usually
        results in new species

> - Microevolution→ shorter periods and results in changes of a
> particular species, but does not create a new species

- Small changes can lead to a dramatic difference

- New varieties or races (Dog Breeds)

-   **Evolution Of The Horse**

    1.  Has a complete fossil record

- Mammal belonging to the family Equidae

> - Evolved over 50 million years from a dog-sized, forest-dwelling
> animal *Hyracotherium*

- Shares a common ancestor with tapirs and rhinoceroses

- Horse evolution has a branching nature (rather than a linear
evolution)

> - The fossil record showed there were several different migrations,
> changes in trends from smaller to larger sizes as well as reduction in
> size. The rate of evolutionary change did not appear to be constant.
>
> - Fossils have shown changes in body size, number of toes and
> dentition (teeth - development of grinding surfaces)
>
> - Genetic variation caused by mutations, natural selection, genetic
> drift and speciation have all contributed to the evolution of the
> horse
>
> - Microevolution can occur when a series of mutations leads to a
> change in gene frequency in a population. This change in the gene pool
> is due to chance and is called genetic drift. If a population becomes
> isolated speciation might occur.
>
> - A small population with a mutated gene may become separated from the
> main population, causing the mutated gene to increase in the
> population as interbreeding occurs. If the change is favourable it is
> selected for (it increases chance of survival)
>
> - The isolated population evolves to become significantly different
> from the original population and eventually if brought back together
> they would not be able to interbreed, resulting in the formation of a
> new species.

-   **Evolution Of The Platypus**

    1.  Platypus shows similar features to birds, reptiles and mammals -
        Webbed feet, venom gland, hair on body

- Genetic evidence suggest that monotremes split off first evolved

- The first split was between marsupials and mammals

> Platypus and echidna share common ancestors

- Very well adapted to the environment it lives in

- Lay an egg with yolk

> - Platypus can located prey with their eyes closed, by sensing
> electric pulses given off by muscles

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image42.png) - A type of macroevolution

-   **Convergent Vs Divergent Evolution**

    1.  Convergent

> - Distantly related species which have moved to similar environments
> and are exposed to similar selection pressures to evolve similarly
>
> - Similar habitats, similar variation would be favoured by natural
> selection to enable them to survive

- Divergent

> - Ancestral species radiates into a number of descendant species with
> both similar and different traits

- Usually influenced by various selection pressures

- An example is Darwin\'s finches

-   **Gradual Natural selection vs Punctuated Equilibrium**

    1.  Gradualism

> - Populations slowly diverge by accumulating changes in
> characteristics due to selection pressures

- Suggest that transitional forms should exist

- Common ancestor

- Small variation

- Punctuated Equilibrium

> - Occurs in short bursts of rapid change, followed by long period of
> stability within populations

- Mutations are passed on

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image43.jpg)

**Evolution- The Evidence**

**Inquiry Question: What is the evidence that supports the Theory of
Evolution by Natural Selection?**

-   **Biochemical Evidence**

    1.  All living things share the same macromolecules such as proteins
        and DNA and biochemical process such as cellular respiration

- Biochemistry is the study of chemicals found in sound

- More closely related species have more similar DNA and proteins

- Similarities imply they had a common ancestor

- Amino Acid Sequencing

- Proteins are a component of all living organism

- Made up of amino acids

> - The sequence of amino acids in the protein is analysed and
> similarities and differences between organisms are identified.

- Differences imply the organism has evolved.

> - Number of differences is proportional to the length of time since
> the organism separated

- DNA Hybridisation

- Samples of DNA are removed from two different organism

- The separated strands of the species to be compared are then mixed.

> - The two strands combine (reassociation) and form a 'hybrid' DNA
> molecule

- The more closely matched the DNA, the tighter the binding.

> - Heat is applied to determine how tightly the DNA strands have
> combined. More closely related species have more similar sequences of
> bases and therefore the strands bind tightly.

- DNA Sequencing

> - The exact order of bases in DNA of one species is compared with a
> similar fragment of another species.

- A piece of DNA is isolated from each organism.

- Multiple copies are made, and dye is used to label the bases.

> - A DNA sequencer is used to graph and print out the sequence of
> bases, which are then compared.

- Organisms that share a common ancestor share fewer differences.

- Provides more detailed information than other biochemical methods.

![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image44.jpg)

-   **Comparative Anatomy**
1.  Study of similarities and differences in the structure of living
        things

> - More similarities imply the organism have separated from a common
> ancestor recently
>
> - Homologous Structures (Divergent Evolution) - Differences in
> structure represent modification.
>
> - Organisms that have the same basic plan to their structure but show
> modifications are called homologous -- they have the same evolutionary
> origins.

- Analogous Structures (Convergent Evolution)

> - Structures that look similar but are very different (e.g. wings of
> bird and wings of grasshopper)

- May have started off differently but over time evolve to look similar.

- E.g. Australian Echidna and European Hedgehog

> - Do not show evolutionary relatedness -- shows the evolution of
> structures for a common purpose.

- Vestigial Structures

> - Evolutionary remnants of body parts that no longer serve a useful
> function.

- Provides evidence of common ancestry.

- E.g. presence of coccyx and appendix in humans.

-   **Comparative Embryology**

    1.  Comparison of development stages of an organism

- Related species show similarities in development

- Fish, mammals, amphibians, birds

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image45.jpg)

-   **Biogeography**

    1.  Study of the distribution of organisms

- For a new species to arise, it must be genetically isolated.

-   **Fossil Evidence**

    1.  Fossils provide direct evidence of the existence of an organism
        in the past

> - The sequence in which fossils are laid down in a rock reflects the
> order in which they were formed

- Law of Superposition

- Further down in a rock represent an older fossil

> - Relative dating relies on the assumption that the fossils higher up
> in the rock are younger than the lower fossils → Fossils are dated
> relative to one another
>
> - Absolute dating enables the actual age of the specimen to be
> determined by using radioactive elements that are present

-   **Modern Day Evolution**

    1.  Cane Toad

> - Faster and larger cane toads have reproduced more, hence the whole
> population is slowly getting faster
>
> - Red-belly black snakes have developed a smaller mouth so they are
> incapable of consuming the organism
>
> - There are no selection pressures on the cane toad, hence they will
> be able to continue to reproduce at exponential rates.

- Antibiotic resistant Bacteria

> - Antibiotics are chemical that inhibit the growth of bacteria or
> destroy them → Target cell wall and inhibit cell metabolism
>
> - When penicillin and other antibiotics were introduced the threat
> posed by infections was reduced
>
> However, strains of bacteria has developed that are not affected by
> antibiotics
>
> - The bacteria that survives passes on genes which leads to a whole
> new variation of bacteria

Module 4 - Ecosystem Dynamics 
============================

**Population Dynamics**

**Inquiry Question: What effect can one species have on the other
species in a community?**

-   **Organisation within ecosystems**

    1.  Biosphere contains all the living thighs on Earth

> - Environments can positively or negatively impact an organism - An
> organism living and non-living surrounds its ecosystem

-   **Impact of Abiotic Factors**

    1.  Abiotic factors are not easily disturbed

- Own unique way of thriving within the limits of the abiotic
environment

- Water is a very effective filter of sunlight

- Rapid drop in temperature

- Oxygen levels

-   **Impact Of Biotic Factors**

    1.  Living organisms can affect each other by predation and
        symbiosis but also have an equally profound effect on resources

- Food sources, mates, light, nutrients, water

- Predation

- Predator obtains its food by killing and eating another animals

- Found in aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems

- Spider capturing bugs in its web and eating it

- Competition

> Competition is usually for a resource in the environment that is
> limited supply but valuable for survival
>
> - All competition involves risk to the competitors and the rewards
> must outweigh the inherent risk

- Intraspecific → Within a species

- Interspecific → Between species

- Symbiotic

> - Interactions in which two organisms live together in a close
> relationship that is beneficial to at least one of them

- Obligate relationship → species depend on each other to live

- Mutualism

- Both organism benefit

> - Clownfish and sea anemone → Clown fish is protected by the sea
> anemone whilst the fish cleans the plant

- Commensalism

- One species is benefited whilst the other is not harmed or helped

- Birds that live in hollow holes in trees

- Parasitism

- One species benefits whilst the other is harmed

> - Parasite obtains shelter from the host organism while feeding upon
> the tissue and fluids

-   **Ecological Niches occupied by Species**

    1.  The part of an ecosystem that the organism occupies is called a
        niche

- Refers to all the resources that a species uses, including biotic and
abiotic

- The process of having unique living strategies

> - Fundamental niche → The perfect conditions and resources for an
> organism to live and reproduce
>
> - Realised Niche → All the aspects of the ecosystem including the
> interactions of other species

-   **Consequences in ecosystems**

    1.  Predation

- Effect the distribution and abundance of prey

- If the prey can reproduce fast enough, rates wont drop

> ![](/statically-image-cdn/uploads/prelimbio1/media/image47.jpg)- Prey and predators are in direct
> proportion

- Competition

> - Effects reproduction and survival rates
>
> - More food sources → More abundance of both species
>
> - Different traits will boost a species survival of getting resources

- Symbiosis

- Increased evolutionary diversification

- Development of new species from the integration of genetic material

> More resilient ecosystems → Biodiversity

- Disease

> - Any process that adversely affects the normal functioning of tissue
> in a living organism

- Bacteria, virus, Pathogen

> - Alter the balance of food webs → Affected species will decline in
> numbers

-   **Recent Extinction**

-   Climate Change

    1.  Continent dried out

> - Rainforests were contracting -- stored moisture and returned
> moisture to the atmosphere.
>
> - Eucalypt forests replaced these, and water was not as efficiently
> retained.

- Became hotter and drier, fires broke out due to lightning.

> - Plants and animals that survived the drought and fire reproduced,
> changing the flora and fauna.

-   Arrival Of Humans

    1.  Aboriginal people arrived successful predators.

- Used 'fire stick' farming techniques.

> - Introduction of dingoes may have reduced the diversity of carnivore
> predators.

-   Level Of Nutrients

    1.  Low level of nutrients in the soil → dry

- Led to smaller animals →F can be sustained on less

> - Evidence for this can be seen in the smaller size of mammals in
> Australia compared to counterparts across the world.

**Past Ecosystems**

**Inquiry Question: How do selection pressures within an ecosystem
influence evolutionary change?**

-   **Past Ecosystems**

    1.  It is unclear when humans first became interested in fossils.

- Philosophers hinted that fossils were evidence of previous life.

- Law of superposition → oldest layer at bottom and newest at top.

-   **Aboriginal Rock Paintings**

    1.  Longest unbroken tradition in the world

- Humans are driven by nature to record details of their existence

- West Kimberly's rock paintings

- Radiometric dating is used to date the paintings

> - Uranium/Thorium can be used to underlying calcite formations to show
> when they were formed

- Types and abundance of animals depicted in paintings changed overtime

-   **Geological Evidence**

    1.  Allows reconstruction of timeline of events

- Represents the course of changes in geological and fossil deposits

- Banded iron Formations

- Form of geochemical evidence found in Australia

> - Earth\'s atmosphere has undergone changes, change from anaerobic to
> aerobic

- Form of iron rich and iron poor sediments

> - Prokaryotes lead to an increase in oxygen concentration in the
> ocean, leading to precipitation of insoluble iron oxide
>
> - Precipitate accumulated at the bottom of the ocean, forming an iron
> rich layer of sediments

- Great oxygenation event transformed Earth's atmosphere

> - Resulted in much larger and multicellular organism→ Organisms had to
> adapt to more oxygen

- Palaeontological Evidence

> - Fossils offer clues to the selection pressures of living things like
> the climate and environment at the time
>
> - Found in sedimentary rocks → Preserve evidence rather than
> destroying it
>
> - Fossilised soils contain large concentrations of carbon that
> indicate presence of life
>
> - Chemosynthesis is a process where organisms use inorganic compounds
> available from their environment.
>
> - The fossils formed from stromalites provide valuable informationof
> early orgaims and the environment in which they lived

-   **Ice Core Drilling**

    1.  Accumulation of ice layers in places such as antarctica leaves
        an annual record of gas and dust in that atmosphere of that time

> - Scientists can drill into the ice, extract gases and reconstruct the
> climate record

- Increases understanding of past environments

-   **Radiometric Dating**

    1.  Process where scientists determine the age in years of a fossil,
        rock or mineral

- Based off the content of radioactive isotopes

> - Unstable isotopes change to form stable isotopes → Undergoes
> radioactive decay which scientists can compare to examine the life of
> the rock

- More half lives → Older

> - Rate of decay is calculated using the *age*​ *equation* that
> compares the abundance of the naturally occurring isotope with the
> abundance of the decay product.

-   **Gas Analysis**

    1.  Scientists can use data in ice cores to reconstruct atmospheric
        concentrations of certain gases, particularly CO~2~​ and O~​~
        2.​

> - CO~2~​ is a normal part of Earth's atmosphere along with nitrogen,
> oxygen, argon and other trace gases
>
> - But CO~2~​ is also considered a 'greenhouse gas' that traps solar
> radiation keeping the Earth warm enough to sustain life
>
> - However, increasing CO~2~​ in atmosphere is likely to increase
> Earth's atmospheric temperature, known as the 'enhanced greenhouse
> effect' or 'global warming'
>
> - Scientists use ancient CO~2~​ levels~​~ to infer past climates -
> warming or cooling would have a direct effect on the types of plants
> and animals that are suited to survive in such a climate
>
> - Oxygen has three naturally occurring isotopes: ^16^​ ^​^O, ^17^​
> ^​^O and ^18^​ ^​^O which are incorporated into water molecules. The
> ratio of ^18^​ O/^​^​^16^ ^​^O in analysed ice core samples indicates
> ancient water temperatures which scientists can use to reconstruct
> water temperatures on Earth.

-   **Small Mammals**

    1.  We Can use fossil of past animals to show similarities and
        differences to present day animals and therefore propose
        evolutionary relationships between them.

> - When comparing the modern platypus to fossils, body shape became
> smaller + more simplified.

- We can infer a change in diet as dentition is different

- Habitat reduced in size → May have become vulnerable.

-   **Reasons for Change**

    1.  Australia's change in climate due to the split of Gondwana

- Climate change

- Arrival of indigenous

> - Introduction of non native plant + animals → invasive species →
> Destroys or affects the natural food web

**Future Ecosystems**

**Inquiry Question: How can human activity impact an ecosystem?**

-   **Human Induced Species**

    1.  Increasing Population

- Selective breeding, use of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides

> - Medical breakthroughs with antibiotics, better hygiene and
> vaccinations
>
> - Increasing populations of humans lead to an increase of the demand
> of resources from ecosystems
>
> - Selective breeding limits the biodiversity of species, hence making
> them more susceptible to being majorly effected by disease or change

- Agriculture

> - Removal of trees leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion → Loss of
> valuable minerals for an ecosystem

- Pollutions harms the water and atmosphere

- Irrigation was developed alongside the domestication of plants

> - Selective breeding of crops and livestock radically altered their
> features to favour large yields

- Introduced Species

> - Many invasive species out compete native species for light, water,
> habitats and nutrients
>
> - Change the environments to alter the microclimate of the areas to
> favour their own development
>
> - Completely alter the food web system which has detrimental effects
> on the rest of the ecosystem

- Land Clearing

> - Refers to the removal of native vegetation for urban and
> agricultural development
>
> - Removes nesting and habitats of native animals → Cannot reestablish
> anywhere else.

- Extinction

- Habitat loss is the leading cause of extinction

> - Most historic extinctions have occurred on islands because a small
> habitat loss has devastating effects
>
> - Extinction opened niches for surviving organism to expand into →
> Rapid development of species

-   **Past To Inform the Future**

    1.  Can estimate rates of extinction by studying recorded extinction
        events, examining fossil record and by analysing modern trends
        in habitat loss

> - Over exploitation of resources → Harvesting an amount that is not
> sustainable over time
>
> - Introduced species → New species effect relationships due to
> competition, predation and disease
>
> - Disruption of ecological relationships → loss of available niches
> alter the distribution and abundance of species

-   **Biodiversity**

    1.  Genetic diversity → Intraspecies diversity in traits that makes
        a population resilient to environmental changes

- Species Diversity → Variety of species in an ecosystem

> - Ecosystem diversity → Variety of ecosystems available in a broader
> area such a continents or globally

-   **Climate Change**

    1.  Greenhouse Effect

- Solar radiation reaches and penetrates earths atmosphere

- Some energy is trapped and absorbed into the land and ocean

- Keeps earth warm and sustainable

- Enhanced Greenhouse

- Increase of concentration of greenhouse gases

- More energy being absorbed in oceans and land

- Warmer climate

- External factors → Solar input from the sun, Earths variety in orbit

> - Internal factors → Active release of CO2 from volcanoes, diffusion
> of CO2 from ocean, less reflection of light from ice (Melting ice is
> bad)

- Human Factors → burning fossil fuels, agriculture, land clearing

-   **Models Predicting Biodiversity**

    1.  Resources increase slow

- Humans grow quick

- Humans will outgrow their ability to feed themselves

- Greater fertility will lead to starvation

- Keep numbers and population in check

-   **Mining Sites**

    1.  Required to follow laws and strict guidelines, which include
        submitting information on how they intended to ensure minimal
        harm to environment

> - All mining companies must complete an environmental impact statement
> as a part of their license application

-   **Land Degradation and Agriculture**

    1.  Marked improvement in the management of Australiansoils and
        waterways

- Farm owners can have their land inspected by scientists

- Management of salinity and erosion are high priorities

- Biological controls are being used to maintain pests
