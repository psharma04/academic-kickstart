## The Role of Operations Management

- Operations refers to the business processes involving **transformation** or production, i.e. inputs into outputs.

- Businesses try to minimize production costs so retail prices are as low as possible.

- Effective operations management adds value to businesses through increasing productivity, lowering costs &

  improving quality, or strategic competitive advantage through **lower costs & differentiated goods**

#### Strategic Role of Operations Management

- Cost leadership
  - Aiming to have lowest cost or be most cost competitive in market ("race to the bottom")
  - Operations managers must also minimize costs so business remains profitable
  - Should create **economies of scale** = producing increased quantities decreases fixed cost per unit

- Product differentiation
  - Offering goods or services distinguished from those of competitors
  - Differentiation sources in **goods**:
  - Product features
    - Product quality
    - Varying augmented features (add-ons or additional benefits e.g. option for built in GPS in a car)
  - Differentiation sources in **services**:
    - Amount of time
    - Qualifications or experience of service provider
    - Quality of materials/technology used in service delivery

### Goods and Services in Different Industries

- **Standardised goods** are mass produced, usually on an assembly line. They are uniform in quality & generally produced with a production focus.
- **Customised goods** vary according to customer needs & produced with a market focus.
- Services can be both standardised & customized (e.g. fast food standardized whereas accounting services are customized).
- Goods can also be classed as perishable or non-perishable:

| Perishable Goods                                             | Non-Perishable Goods                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| High standards of safety, quality & cleanliness in all operating processes | More durable than perishables           |
| Very short shelf-life, therefore rapid distribution          | Includes household and business goods   |
| Appropriate, sturdy packaging, and cold storage              | Requires effective inventory management |

#### Interdependence with Other Key Business Functions

- Marketing
  - Research nature of goods consumers want
  - Marketing strategies to encourage purchases
- Human Resources
  - Provide suitable staff & organize training based on requirements of operations
  - Uses leadership style + rewards to ensure quality work is done by employees in operations
- Finance
  - Budgets & makes funds available for inputs, equipment, repairs/ maintenance.
  - Minimizes production costs to maximize profit margins

### Influences on Operations

#### Globalisation

- Refers to the removal of trade barriers between nations.
- Characterized by increased integration of national economies & high flow of money, labor, ideas, financial resources.
- Large businesses selling to global markets and meeting needs of global customers
- Businesses establishing global supply chain to reduce costs:
  - Global web = network of supplierâ€™s business has chosen on basis of lowest cost, lowest risk and maximum certainty in quality & timing of supplies.

#### Technology

- New technologies in production and operations has allowed for less energy, less waste and faster production
- **Robotics** allow for greater precision in sophisticated production processes and also easy standardization of products
  - Includes **CAD** & **CAM**

#### Quality Expectations

- How well designed, made and functional goods are and the degree of competence in which services are organized and delivered.
- **Goods:**
  - quality of design
  - fitness for purpose
  - durability
- **Services:**
  - professionalism of service provider
  - reliability of service provider
  - level of customization

#### Cost-Based Competition

- Derived from determining breakeven point then applying strategies to create cost advantages over competitors.
- Base cost of a product involves fixed and variable costs
- Ways to cut costs include purchasing bulk inputs or updating technology

#### Government Policies

- Since policies can inform law making and lead to business opportunities, operations mangers need be aware of current government policies and what they comprise

- Includes required materials handling practices, OHS standards, public health polices, environmental policies

#### Legal Regulations

- **Compliance costs** = expenses associated with meeting requirements of legal regulation

- Federal and state law ensures:

  - Safe operations (e.g. WHS in machinery use)

  - Consumer protection (product minimum safety/quality standards)
  - Minimal environmental impact

- Unions also play a key role in promoting safety in workplace operations as well as industrial awards

#### Environmental Sustainability

- Practices that allow resources to be used today without compromising future access
- Significantly impacted by **climate change awarenes**s and the need to integrate **long-term sustainable view** of resource management.
- This can be seen in businesses efforts to reduce and minimize waste; recycle water, glass, paper metals & reduce their **carbon footprint**.

### Corporate Social Responsibility

- Refers to open and accountable business actions based on respect for people, community & the broader environment, more than just following the law
- The "triple bottom line", composed of profit, social justice, and environmental protection is crucial to modern corporate social responsibility.

#### Legal Compliance vs Ethical Responsibility

- Legal requirements require businesses to follow the letter of the law.
- This includes prescribed standards & workers protections, and is enforceable by governments and judicial systems.
- Ethical responsibility is more about the spirit of the law, and the generally accepted cultural standards of the target audience.
- Variations in laws between countries can make ethical standards difficult to maintain for large international companies, although many follow the guidelines of the ILO where available.

#### Environmental Sustainability

- Requires businesses to evaluate the environmental effects of their operations.
- There is a growing expectation for products to be clean, green, and safe, so businesses have been focusing on improving their sustainability.
- Younger generations, especially Gen Z, tend to prioritise sustainability over factors such as brand name recognition.

## Operations Processes

#### Inputs

- There are 4 common direct inputs:

  - Labour
  - Energy
  - Raw Materials
  - Technology

  > The UNSW AGSM has asked me to note that Energy and Raw Materials are often consolidated into "production components" in university-level economics courses, while Technology is often consolidated with the concept of Capital.

#### Transformation Processes

Transformation processes can be described using the 4 V's:

- Volume
  - Amount of goods produced
  - This can also tie in with volume flexibility, which is how quickly production can be adapted or scaled to match demand
  - High volume flexibility is required to effectively manage "lead times" (time from order to completion)
- Variety
  - Number of models/variations of a product/service
  - More variety means a higher technology cost, and will reduce profit margins as economies of scale are less effective.
- Variation in Demand
  - How much of a product is needed
  - Increased demand requires more raw material, labour, machinery, and energy consumption
- Visibility
  - Degree to which customers can view the operations process
  - Manufacturing and supply chain-based processes tend to be low-visibility, while service-based industries are typically high visibility.

#### Technology

- Many products designed and assembled using CAD and CAM
- Technology allows businesses to relocate dangerous or repetitive tasks away from employees
- This has enabled more efficient production, although technology is expensive it is usually more cost effective long term.

#### Task design

- Breaking down a large task into smaller, manageable activities
- Employees therefore able to perform and complete the task successfully.
- Involves job analysis & can be done after conduction of a skills audit.

#### Process layout

- Arranging machinery according to what they do â†’ product moves from department to department
- Allows for more flexibility & customization of the product

#### Monitoring, Control, and Improvement

- Monitoring is arranged around the need to measure key performance indicators (KPI's), such a lead times, defect rates, and inventory turnover.
- Corrective action is then taken based on the KPI's in an effort to improve the company's outcomes
- Improvement refers to the reduction of "bottlenecks", which are steps in the process that cause delays, inefficiencies, or wastage.

### Outputs

- Businesses have 2 main outputs: customer service, and warranties.

  - Customer service refers to how well the business can meet the expectations of customers.

  - Operations management is responsible for the provision & quality of the product, as if customers are disappointed in these things they will go elsewhere.

  - Warranties refer to the guarantee that a product will serve its advertised purpose, as well as the expected lifespan of the product.
  - Many businesses are required by law to have warranties on their products, as a form of consumer protection. 

## Operations Strategies

### Performance Objectives

#### Quality

- Informs the decisions of consumers for future purchases, key element of maintaining brand value and consumer trust.
- This includes quality of design, but also quality of conformance and quality of service.

#### Speed

- Time taken for production and other operations processes to respond to market demand. 
- Companies aim to satisfy customer demands as soon as possible.
- Goals include reducing lead time, high-speed shipping and distribution, and accessibility.

#### Dependability

- Product lifetime
- Measured by warranty claims and complaints compared to units sold

#### Flexibility

- Refers to how quickly operations processes can adjust to changes in material supply and product demand

#### Customisation

- Creation of individualised products to meet specific customer needs
- More customisation usually results in higher customer satisfaction, but reduces economies of scale, making products more expensive to produce

#### Cost

- People don't like paying more for things.
- Minimising the expenses of operations allows the cost of a product to be lowered, increasing the chance that a consumer will buy it
- Better technologies improve the efficiency of manufacturing in both energy and material waste.

#### Research and Development

- R&D typically is driven by:
  - Consumer preferences
  - Changes and innovations in technology
- Companies will focus on using cutting-edge technology to both reduce cost and increase quality, as well as focusing on consumer feedback in order to design new products.

#### Supply Chain Management
