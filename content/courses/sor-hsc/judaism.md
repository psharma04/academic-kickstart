### Significant Person: Moses Maimonides
- [Overview](/post/moses-maimonides/)
- [Commentary on the Mishnah (1168)](/post/moses-commentary1/)
- [Mishneh Torah (1170-1180)](/post/moses-commentary2/)
- [Guide for the Perplexed (1190)](/post/moses-commentary3/)
  
  > It really doesn't get more compressed than that
### Ethics: Bioethics
Ethical teachings:
*   Pikuach Nefesh (preservation of life)
*   Tzelem Elokim (made in the image of God)
*   Commandments of the Torah (laws and mitzvot - positive ones to be upheld and negative ones to be refrained from)
#### Pikuach Nefesh
Abortion and Euthanasia: directs Jews to not interfere, but rather *preserve* life
- What they will do: avoid abortion **unless under specific circumstances**
- Quote: *“there is a time to be born and a time to die”*
<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Orthodox - </strong>traditional and strict
   </td>
   <td><strong>Progressive -</strong> Move with the times
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Oppose: should preserve life
   </td>
   <td>Support: if the mother’s quality of life is at jeopardy
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Tzelem Elokim
Surrogacy: directs Jews to conceive naturally with biological sex cells to respect G-d’s omnipotence as creator.
- What they will do: condemn surrogacy and not engage with it
- Quote: “Thou shall not commit adultery”
<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Conservative -</strong> want to <em>conserve</em> the laws
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Oppose: Sex cells must come biologically therefore to maintain the commandment “thou shall not commit adultery”
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Commandments of the Torah
Gene therapy: direct Jews that they are the co-custodians of creation and help preserve G-d's creation
- What will they do: Jews may edit G-d's creation in order to “subdue” creation for positive reasons
- Quote: “Fulfill the earth and subdue it”
<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Orthodox</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Progressive</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Follow a range of mitzvot
   </td>
   <td>If it benefits creation
   </td>
  </tr>

## Significant Practice: Marriage

- Marriage is a significant practice in the Jewish tradition, symbolising the union of a *chatan* (groom) and *kallah* (bride)
- NOTE: Marriage is a *rite*, not a ritual, as Jewish adherents are expected to be married *once* in their lives.
#### Stages of the rite
- The Jewish marriage ceremony can be split into 2 distinct components: *Kiddushin* (dedication) and *nisuin* (marriage)
  - Kiddushin basically stops the chatan and kallah from trying to marry anyone else.
    - In modern traditions, the Kiddushin is usually where the legal marriage contract is signed.
    - After Kiddushin, a *get* (Jewish divorce contract) is required if the couple wishes to split
  - Nisuin is the official religious marriage ritual
  > Nisuin can be thought of as the bit where they tell G-d that they're married now
  - Nisuin is the requirement for a marriage to be recognised by Jewish law.
  - Nisuin has historically occured up to a year after Kiddushin, but nowadays, both Nisuin and Kiddushin are performed as part of one longer ceremony

##### Kiddushin

###### Aufruf
- "Calling up" of the groom to read the Torah
- Occurs during Shabbat 1 week before the wedding
- _In progressive Jewish traditions, both the bride and groom read from the Torah_

###### Mikveh
- Orthodox Jewish women visit the Mikveh pool
- Form of ritual purification before marriage
- Occurs one week before the wedding

###### Badeken
- "Veiling of the bride"
- First time the Chatan and Kallah see each other on the wedding day

###### Reading of the Ketubah
- The Ketubah is read aloud to those gathered
- The Ketubah outlines the obligations of the groom to the bride, including food, clothing, and "marital relations"
  
  > :eyes:
- The ketubah is considered a legally binding contract, although some countries[^33011] do not recognise it in their legal systems
- In orthodox traditions, the Ketubah is read in Aramaic, while Progressive and Modern couples may elect to have it read in their local language as well, or for a shortened version to be read.
- The reading of the Ketubah marks the end of Kiddushin

##### Nisuin

###### Chuppah
- Chatan and Kallah approach the *Chuppah* (A canopy supported by 4 poles or attendants) with their parents after signing the Ketubah
- The Chuppah represents the new home that will be built by the couple after marriage
- Remainder of the ceremony occurs under the Chuppah

###### Circling of the Groom
- Kallah circles the chatan 7 times
- Symbolises the breaking down of walls between the couple
- *In Progressive traditions, the groom and bride circle each other*

###### Birkat Erusin
- Initial blessings are said over wine
- Performed by rabbi or family member
- After the blessings, the Chatan and Kallah drink from the wine

###### Giving of the Rings
- The chatan places a ring on the finger of the kallah
- Chatan says:
> "Behold you are sanctified (betrothed) to me with this ring, according to the Law of Moses and Israel."

###### Sheva Berakhot
- "Seven Blessings"
- Formalises *Nisuin*
- After the [blessings](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-sheva-berakhot/) are read, the chatan and kallah drink from the same cup

###### Breaking Of The Glass
- The glass from the [Sheva Berakhot](#sheva-berakhot) is wrapped in a cloth and broken under the foot of the chatan
- Serves as a reminder that even in great times, the couple will encounter strife

### Marriage and the beliefs of Judaism
Marriage is an expression of the beliefs of Judaism, allowing adherents to fulfil their religious obligations.
- Aufruf, for example, serves as a fulfilment of the Covenant (Mitzvah 17)
  
  > ["Teach them [the words of the Torah] to your children" (Deuteronomy 6:7)](https://torah.org/learning/mitzvah-17/#:~:text=Teach%20them%20%5Bthe%20words%20of%20Torah%5D%20to%20your,learning%20so%20that%20it%20is%20clear%20and%20precise.)
- The Ketubah can be seen as a reflection of the Covenant, in that it is a religious contract between the couple and G-d
- Sheva Berakhot frequently reminds adherents of their belief in one god
  
  > ["Hear O Israel! The LORD our G-d, the LORD is One" (Deuteronomy 6:4)](https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#4)
