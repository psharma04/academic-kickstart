## The Purpose of Research

- Research is designed to advance knowledge and increase the understanding of specific topics and issues, with the aim of education and information.
- Research is designed to discover new information, trends, and patterns relating to observed phenomena.
- Research usually has the purpose of improving the efficacy of a process.

> **Efficacy** is the ability to produce a desired or intended result. For example, market research is usually designed to increase sales, which is the desired result of a company. Medical research is designed to increase the success and reliability of treatments, which is the desired result of that field.

### The Focus of Research

- Research is typically focused on evaluating existing information, and assessing what is known or left out.
- Research requires a **Hypothesis**: a statement which one seeks to prove true or false in the course of an investigation or study.
- A hypothesis has three key properties:
  - States a relationship between two variables
  - Clear, definite, and non-ambiguous
  - Testable and Falsifiable

### Sampling

- Sampling refers to the characteristic of the chosen quantity of people, and involves the availability and access to the people used in a study.
- Sample populations should be as varied as possible (within the criteria for the research) in order to minimise systematic errors in the results.
- There are several common methods of sampling. These methods outline how a sample group should be chosen.

| Method      | Definition                                                   | Example                                                      | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Random      | Completely randomised selection, everyone has an equal chance of being chosen. | Names out of a hat, wheel of fortune.                        | For complete randomness.                                     |
| Systematic  | The researcher uses an algorithmic method of selecting a sample, where the selection criteria has nothing to do with the actual study. | Every 6th person from an alphabetical list for a study on English marks. | When variation in the sample is required, but complete randomness is not an option. |
| Clustered   | Specific criteria are used to select individuals, with commonalities between all of them. | Individuals with diabetes for a study on a new treatment.    | If a study is only relevant to a specific group of people.   |
| Convenience | People considered by the researcher to be "accessible" (such as family and friends) are more likely to be chosen. **This is a very bad method for actual research.** | Sending a survey to friends as a precursor to actual opinion polls. | To get an idea of the potential outcome of the research. This method should never be used in actual sample creation. |
| Quota       | The researcher has prerequisites for who is included in the research. | A study on alcohol consumption limited to over 18s.          | Similar to clustered, this is used when a study should only be relevant to a particular group. |
| Snowball    | Researchers use a different method to get initial respondants, and then those respondants forward other people to the researcher (also known as the affiliation method). | Social media polls.                                          | To increase the number of responses to the research, increasing the reliability of the results. |
| Stratified  | The selectable population is split into separate groups, and then a random sample is taken from each group. | A study of Alzheimer's disease splits the available individuals into those who have the disease and those who don't. | To establish a control sample.                               |



### Sample Groups

- The sample group is the final group that will participate in the research.
- Ideally, the sample group is as diverse as possible (within the confines of the testing criteria).
- The sample size is the number of people in the sample group. Usually, a larger sample group is better, as it is a more accurate representation of the wider population.

## Types of Data

- Primary data is data that is collected by a researcher from first-hand sources, using methods like surveys, interviews, or experiments. 
  - It is collected with the research project in mind, directly from primary sources.

- Secondary data is data that has already been collected through primary sources and made readily available for researchers to use for their own research.

- Qualitative data is data that approximates and characterizes. 
  - Qualitative data can be observed and recorded. 
  - This data type is non-numerical in nature. 
  - This type of data is collected through methods of observations, one-to-one interviews, conducting focus groups, and similar methods.
  - Qualitative data are measures of 'types' and may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code.

- Quantitative data are measures of values or counts and are expressed as numbers. 
  - Quantitative data are data about numeric variables (e.g. how many; how much; or how often). 

### Sources of Data

- Secondary data is typically in the form of either print or digital sources.
- These are used to construct a literature review on the research topic.
- Print sources tend to include books, newspapers, and magazines.
- Digital sources include academic journals, websites, documentaries, and social media.

## Reliability, Validity, and Accuracy

- When you are conducting research, the three most important factors are the validity, reliability, and accuracy of your results. 
- Reliability means consistency within your results. Essentially, another researcher should be able to follow your experimental procedure and get the same results.
- Validity is how well your results respond to the research question. This is typically affected by bias from either the researcher or the sample population.
- Accuracy is how similar your results are to the theoretical answer. In CAFS, this usually means that the results should align with the research of your literature review.

### Ethical Behaviour

- There are certain ethical considerations to maintain when conducting research.
- Significant factors include a person's right to privacy, and the emotional/physical/mental impact of the research.
- Objectivity must be maintained in order to maintain an ethical standing (this is why polling family and friends is considered bad research).
- The acronym BIRP can be used to remember the components of ethical behaviour:
  - B - Bias - when the researcher's point of view influences their findings.
  - I - Integrity - A researcher must be honest and truthful, and must not modify or suppress components of their data to influence results.
  - R - Respect - As research often requires human participants, it is important to plan questions so they aren't led to answers, and that you have recieved [Free, Prior, and Informed Consent.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210915021350/https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/appendix-4-elements-common-understanding-free-prior-and-informed-consent-social-justice)
  - P - Privacy - Avoid the use of names or identifying information wherever possible, unless it is somehow necessary to the research. This is especially important when doing research on socially, culturally, and legally tumultuous topics.

## Research Methods

- Research can be conducted using a variety of methods, depending on the nature of the investigation and the types of data required.

### Questionnaires

- Questionnaires are a set of pre-prepared questions that seek information on a person's knowledge, beliefs, feelings and/or opinions.

| Pros                                       | Cons                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cost efficient                             | Limited by available time of participants                    |
| Can reach a larger sample size             | Limited answer choices                                       |
| Standardised questions = easier processing | Tradeoffs are necessary between standardised responses (i.e. multiple choice for easy processing). |

### Structured Interviews

- A conversation between 2 or more people in which the interview has been planned with a set of predetermined questions developed by the researcher.

| Pros                 | Cons           |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Open-Ended Questions | Time Consuming |
| Active observations  | Prone to bias  |

### Unstructured Interviews

- A discussion between two or more people in which the interview is more informal, with the researchers planning topics rather than specific questions.

- Tend to be more flexible than other methods, but inexperienced interviewers might ask leading questions which can taint the data.

### Case Studies

- A detailed investigation of a topic using both primary and secondary data.
- Multiple sources of data are typically used in order to generalise more effectively about a topic.

### Observations

- The process of watching and recording behaviours of participants.
- Sometimes the researcher will themselves be a participant in the activity.
- Effective for measuring the interactions within a group.

### Literature Reviews

- A logical and methodical way of organising the existing literature on a topic.
- Literature reviews involve locating relevant information from existing primary and secondary sources, such as academic journals.
- Articles should be reviewed, summarised, and analysed for the final report.

## Planning for Research

### Formulating a Research Proposal

- The proposal is a summary and outline of what you intend to research.
- In the proposal, key features include the research question, a hypothesis, a brief literature review, an explanation of the purpose of the research, and a timeline of how long you expect each section to take.

### Managing Resources

- When undertaking research, it is important that the allocation of resources is organised BEFORE the project begins.
  - This includes time, because that's usually the most limiting factor after cost.
- The project log is a good way to organise this.

### Conducting Research

#### Accessing, Collecting, and Recording Sources of Data

- Use of digital sources is the most efficient way to locate things you need. 
- [You can find some good resources for digital data here.](https://bafybeigjcukahhlj4dri7mfoeowekvlhvepnybagym3ngbr6y5jbdfp7cq.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com/)

#### Documenting Actions and Issues

- While conducting research, you should be documenting actions and issues throughout the recording actions, and proposing solutions to these issues.
- The project diary for your IRP is a record of these actions and issues, indicating the work done both at school and at home.
- Project diaries should contain:
  - Outline of the process
  - Sources of data
  - Methods used to collect data
  - Positive and Negative Experiences
  - Personal Opinions and Comments
  - Problems that occurred and solutions
  - Decisions made

### Presenting Research Findings

- To present the research findings, a researcher must use both quantitative data (through graphs and tables) as well as qualitative descriptions of trends.
- Research should then be analysed by comparing your own findings to primary and secondary data.
- Conclusions should then be drawn in relation to the overall findings of the investigation, as well as what was learnt and recommendations for future research.
