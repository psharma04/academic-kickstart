{{< callout warning >}}

This module includes sections which use outdated terminology and reference slurs regarding disability, homelessness, gender (primarily trans and intersex identities), immigrants, people of colour, lesbian/gay/bisexual people, single parents, and Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander people. This is for the purpose of education on why the slurs and terms are problematic, and in absolutely no way encourages the use of these terms.



If you have experienced/experience interactions where people use these terms and it has upset you, [click here to lodge a complaint with the AHRC](https://humanrights.gov.au/complaints/make-complaint), or [here to access mental health resources and support.](https://bafybeidinz7alcw7rxidaoc6wv732kotfq6dn772grhcavcdgnbrttc6u4.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com/)



Be a good personâ„¢.

## People with Disabilities

### What is Disability?

- Disability is typically defined as a condition which interrupts a person's ability to perform "basic" activities, usually involving self-care, mobility, or communication.
- Disability has many levels, ranging from mild inconveniences to complete dependence on others for basic function.

#### Prevalence within the community

- Approximately 17.7% of Australians are considered "disabled" under Australian law, which is 4.4 million people.[^1]

### Diversity within a Group

- The extent of a person's disability is typically the determining factor in how much they rely on the people around them.
- Additionally, some disabilities may be temporary (e.g. requiring crutches after breaking a leg), while others may have long-term effects.
- Disabilities also include mental illness, not just physical issues.

### Terminology used to describe a group

| Positive terms                    | Negative/Degrading terms                |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Person with disability            | ...suffering from...                    |
| Person with [condition X]         | Crippled/retarded                       |
| Person experiencing [Condition X] | Disadvantaged/unfortunate/special needs |

##### Why are the negative terms problematic?

- The negative terms listed tend to either be undermining and degrading to the person they are being used to describe.
- This results in increased prejudice against that individual, which can lead to issues in the workplace, at home, and in general society, as well as issues of identity and self-confidence.
- Use of the positive terms allows the disability component to be treated as an adjective rather than a noun, meaning the individual is defined as a "person" first. 

### Issues of Concern

#### Satisfaction of Needs

- Many of the barriers faced by people with physical or intellectual disabilities are a result of societal stereotypes regarding their condition.
- For example, many "modern" urban development environments make use of shades of grey in their sidewalks rather than the usual yellow tactile paving. As a result of this, partially blind people are unable to navigate as easily.

Tom Scott's video on tactile paving explains this concept a lot better than I have.

#### Health

- Depending on the type and severity of people's disabilities, they will have different levels of health/wellbeing.
- Some people are able to care for themselves, only requiring mild assistance, while others require near-constant support from professionals. 
- Additionally, some disabilities can also lead to other complications depending on the nature of the issue.

#### Education

- Some conditions, especially mental conditions, can significantly affect an individual's education.
- Education departments in Australia (such as the DET and NESA) are required to provide support systems in order to ensure that these issues have a minimal effect on their education.
- Universities and other tertiary systems (e.g. TAFE) are also providing additional support services for people with disabilities.

#### Employment

- People with disability tend to experience heavy discrimination when applying for jobs.
- This, combined with the restrictions imposted by certain conditions, means that over 50% of individuals recognised to have disabilities are considered unemployed.
- While Centrelink offers employment services to these individuals, many workplaces also heavily discriminate against individuals with disabilities.

#### Safety, Security, and Identity

- Many of the systems used by the majority of the community on a daily basis include safety systems in order to reduce risk of harm.
  - For example, emergency fire exists.
- However, many of these systems are inaccessible or impractical for use by disabled individuals in an emergency.
  - A fire escape with stairs is not of much help to someone in a wheelchair.
- Additionally, discrimination and violence against disabled people is prevalent in Australian society, ranging from verbal abuse to physical harms.
- As a result, many individuals with disability experience low self-esteem.
- They might compare themselves with people who do not have a disability and might concentrate on the experiences they are as yet unable to have.

### Access to Services

#### Types of services

- Depending on the person's disability, various suitable services are available for targeting financial support, transport, accommodation and housing, healthcare, counselling, education, employment, and legal aid.
  - For example, CP Australia provides services for people who have cerebral palsy.
- People with disabilities often require access to financial aid, such as Centerlink's Disability Support Pension.

#### Factors affecting Access to Services

- A variety of factors affect a person's access to these services, such as the nature and severity of their condition(s).
- The characteristics of the person's condition may affect their capacitty to understand what procedures are required to access an available service. As a result, they will not have the opportunity to engage with the service.
- Additionally, an individual's access to resources may affect their access. For example, someone who lives in rural NSW will not be able to access the support groups located in major cities.
- Finally, limitations of the programs and services (such as funding) may result in a highly selective eligibilty criteria, resulting in people who may require support not being included in a specific scheme as a result.

## Homeless People

- Homelessness is the term used to describe individuals who do not have access to a regular, safe, and secure residence.
- In 2011, over 100000 Australians were considered to be homeless, amounting to about 5 people in every thousand.
- Homelessness is prevalent in many countries, and frequently becomes a cycle as a result of systems designed to reduce social mobility.
- Stigma regarding homelessness is also extremely prevalent, especially in Australian society (think about your own thoughts and reactions when passing a homeless person in the street).
- While the association of homelessness with substance abuse is extremely common, the majority of homeless individuals in Australia are subjects of domestic violence, abuse, poverty, failing health, and lack of support.
- Younger homeless people are often said to have "fallen through the cracks" of society as a result of neglect at some stage in their life.

#### Diversity within the group

- As homelessness has only 1 defining criteria, this group is extremely diverse.

| Location of Residence                     | 2001  | 2001 % | 2006  | 2006 % | 2011   | 2011 % |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Improvised dwellings/tents                | 8946  | 9      | 7247  | 8      | 6813   | 6      |
| Homeless shelters/supported accommodation | 13420 | 14     | 17329 | 19     | 21258  | 20     |
| Temporary residence in other households   | 17880 | 19     | 17663 | 20     | 17269  | 17     |
| Boarding houses                           | 21300 | 22     | 15460 | 17     | 17721  | 17     |
| Other temporary lodging                   | 338   | <1     | 500   | 1      | 686    | 1      |
| 'Severely' crowded dwellings              | 33430 | 35     | 31531 | 35     | 41390  | 39     |
| **All Homeless Persons**                  | 95314 | 100    | 89728 | 100    | 105237 | 100    |

- As a result of the size and diversity of this group, a single solution doesn't solve this societal issue.

##### Age Groups of Homeless Australians

| Age      | Population % |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Under 12 | 17           |
| 12-18    | 10           |
| 19-24    | 15           |
| 25-34    | 18           |
| 35-44    | 14           |
| 45-54    | 12           |
| 55-65    | 8            |
| 65+      | 6            |

#### Terminology used to describe a group

- The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) splits homelessness into 4 categories:
  - Primary homelessness - having neither temporary nor permanent shelter (this is the traditional definition of homelessness).
  - Secondary homelessness - Having temporary accommodation but having to move frequently (e.g. shelters/boarding houses).
  - Tertiary homelessness - having access to shelter for the medium to long term future, but not having secured tenure (e.g. property title, lease, contracts). Includes housing with family/friends while "getting back on your feet".
  - Marginal housing - Having access to a shelter for the medium to long term future, but in a manner which is close to the minimum standard.

- In general, homelessness requires that the standard of "safe and adequate housing" is not met. This requires at least 1 of the following categories to be fulfilled:
  - The person's health either has been or is likely to be affected by living there,
  - The person's safety is threatened by living there,
  - The person does not have access to adequate amenities, economic or social supports expected from a permanent residence,
  - The person is in a situation where the adequacy, safety, security, and affordability of the housing is adversely affected.

### Issues of Concern

#### Satisfaction of Needs

- Homeless people often struggle to meet their basic needs, as a result of the financial limitations of their situation.
