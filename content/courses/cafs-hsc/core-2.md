{{< callout warning >}}

This module includes sections which use outdated terminology and reference slurs regarding disability, homelessness, gender (primarily trans and intersex identities), immigrants, people of colour, lesbian/gay/bisexual people, single parents, and Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander people. This is for the purpose of education on why the slurs and terms are problematic, and in absolutely no way encourages the use of these terms.



If you have experienced/experience interactions where people use these terms and it has upset you, [click here to lodge a complaint with the AHRC](https://humanrights.gov.au/complaints/make-complaint), or here to access mental health resources and support.



Be a good personâ„¢.

## People with Disabilities

### What is Disability?

- Disability is typically defined as a condition which interrupts a person's ability to perform "basic" activities, usually involving self-care, mobility, or communication.
- Disability has many levels, ranging from mild inconveniences to complete dependence on others for basic function.

#### Prevalence within the community

- Approximately 17.7% of Australians are considered "disabled" under Australian law, which is 4.4 million people.[^1]

### Diversity within a Group

- The extent of a person's disability is typically the determining factor in how much they rely on the people around them.
- Additionally, some disabilities may be temporary (e.g. requiring crutches after breaking a leg), while others may have long-term effects.
- Disabilities also include mental illness, not just physical issues.

### Terminology used to describe a group

| Positive terms                    | Negative/Degrading terms                |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Person with disability            | ...suffering from...                    |
| Person with [condition X]         | Crippled/retarded                       |
| Person experiencing [Condition X] | Disadvantaged/unfortunate/special needs |

##### Why are the negative terms problematic?

- The negative terms listed tend to either be undermining and degrading to the person they are being used to describe.
- This results in increased prejudice against that individual, which can lead to issues in the workplace, at home, and in general society, as well as issues of identity and self-confidence.
- Use of the positive terms allows the disability component to be treated as an adjective rather than a noun, meaning the individual is defined as a "person" first. 

### Issues of Concern

### Satisfaction of Needs

- Many of the barriers faced by people with physical or intellectual disabilities are a result of societal stereotypes regarding their condition.
- For example, many "modern" urban development environments make use of shades of grey in their sidewalks rather than the usual yellow tactile paving. As a result of this, partially blind people are unable to navigate as easily.

Tom Scott's video on tactile paving explains this concept a lot better than I have.
