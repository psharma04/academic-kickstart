## Types of Reactions
### Decomposition Reactions
- Decomposition reactions involve breaking down one compound into 2 or more simpler substances
- Decomposition is an ENDOTHERMIC reaction, meaning it reuqires heat input
- An example of a decomposition reaction is carbonate decomposition:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{CuCO_3}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{CuO+CO_2}\\)
>
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Green: Reactants}}\\)
>
> \\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Light Blue: Products}}\\)
#### Decomposition by light
- Some compounds will decompose when exposed to light
- An example is Silver Nitrate (\\(AgNO_3\\)):
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{AgNO_3}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{2Ag + 2NO_2 +O_2 }\\)
- Light-based decomposition is the basis of film photography
### Combustion Reactions
- Combustion reactions occur when something __burns__
- Combustion reactions are EXOTHERMIC (i.e. light, sound, heat are usually produced)
- Oxygen (or any oxidizer) is always a component of a combustion reaction
- An example of a combustion reaction is burning Propane:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{2C_3 H_{8(g)} +7O_{2(g)}}\\)$\rightarrow$\\(\color{lightblue}{2C_{(s)} + 2CO_{(g)}+ 2CO_{2(g)} +8H_2 O_{(g)}}\\)
- Some combustion reactions only have \\(CO_2\\) and $H_2 O$ as products
  - These are known as "complete combustion reactions"
  - An example of a complete combustion reaction is burning Methane:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{CH_4 +2O_2}\\)$\rightarrow$\\(\color{lightblue}{CO_2 +2H_2 O}\\)
### Precipitation Reactions
- When soluble ionic compounds are dissolved in water, the lattice "dissolves", and the ions are separated
![Image of the dissolution of an ionic compound](https:///csec-cdn/schoolnotes.intranet.pw/dissolution-of-an-ionic-compound-in-water-n.jpg)
- If two solutions are mixed together, it's really just 4 different ions suspended in water
- However, certain combinations of ions will form an insoluble compound when mixed
- These compounds will form a PRECIPITATE, a small ionic crystal lattice
- This is known as a precipitation reaction
- An example is mixing sodium sulfide and copper sulfate solutions:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{Na_2 S_{(aq)}+CuSO_{4(aq)}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{CuS_{(s)}+Na_2SO_{4(aq)}}\\)


#### Solubility Rules
The solubility rules are used to determine which compound is the precipitate.

| Ion           | Soluble? | Exceptions                         |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| $NO_{3}^-$    | ✅        | ❌                                  |
| $ClO_{4}^-$   | ✅        | ❌                                  |
| $Cl^-$        | ✅        | $Ag, Hg_2 , Pb$                    |
| $I^-$         | ✅        | $Ag, Hg_2 ,Pb$                     |
| $SO_{4}^{2-}$ | ✅        | $Ca, Ba, Sr, Hg, Pb, Ag$           |
| $CO_{3}^{2-}$ | ❌        | Alkalis and Ammonium               |
| $PO_4 ^{3-}$  | ❌        | Alkalis and Ammonium               |
| $OH^-$        | ❌        | Alkalis, $Ca, Ba, Sr$              |
| $S^{2-}$      | ❌        | Alkalis, Alkaline Earths, Ammonium |
| $Na^+$        | ✅        | ❌                                  |
| $NH_4 ^+$     | ✅        | ❌                                  |
| $K^+$         | ✅        | ❌                                  |
#### NAGSAG and PMS (Mnemonics)
- NAGSAG can be used to remember common soluble ions:
> N - Nitrates ($NO_{3}^-$)
>
> A - Acetates ($C_2 H_3 O_2 ^- $)
>
> G - Group 1 ($Li^+ , Na^+ , K^+ , etc. $)
>
> S - Sulfates ($SO_{4}^{2-}$)
>
> A - Ammonium ($NH_4 ^+$)
>
> G - Group 17 ($F^- , Cl^- , Br^- , I^- , etc.$)

- PMS can be used to remember exceptions:
> P - $Pb^{2+}$ (Lead)
>
> M - Mercury
>
> S - Silver

### Corrosion Reactions
- Corrosion is a reaction involving a metallic element being converted into a more chemically stable form (e.g. an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide)
- Combustion and Corrosion are both types of "oxidization reactions"
- Corrosion is EXOTHERMIC, although not as much as combustion
- An example of corrosion is iron rusting:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{4Fe+3O_2}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{2Fe_2 O_3}\\)
### Acids and Bases
#### Neutralization Reactions
- When an acid and base are added together, they "neutralise" each other
- This creates water and an ionic compound known as a "salt"
- The general formula for acid-base reactions is:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Acid}+\text{Base}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Salt}+H_2 O}\\)
#### Acid-Metal Reactions (Displacement Reactions)
- Many metals will react with Acids to produce a "salt" and Hydrogen gas (\\(H_2\\))
- The general formula for Acid-Metal reactions is:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Acid}+\text{Metal}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Salt}+H_2}\\)
#### Acid-Carbonate Reactions
- When an acid reacts with a carbonate compound, the products are always \\(\ce{CO2}\\), \\(H_2 O\\), and a salt
- The general formula is:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Acid}+\text{Carbonate Compound}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Salt}+H_2 O + CO_2 }\\)
### Redox Reactions
- Redox is short for "Reduction-Oxidization"
- Redox reactions occur between 2 substances, where electrons are LOST by one (the reductant), and GAINED by the other (the oxidant)
- An easy way to remember this is with AN OIL RIG CAT:
  - AN - at the ANode,
  - OIL - Oxidization Involves Loss of electrons
  - RIG - Reduction Involves Gain of electrons
  - CAT - at the CAThode
#### Rules
1. Metals are always reductants, Metal IONS are always Oxidants
2. Oxygen has an oxidation state of $2-$ (unless in a peroxide)
3. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of 1+ (except in metal hydrides)
4. Free elements have an oxidation state of 0
5. The oxidation state of an ion is equal to it's charge
6. In compounds, the sum of all oxidation states is 0
7. The halogens (F, Cl, Br and I) typically have an oxidation state of 1- in their ionic compounds. In molecular compounds their oxidation number is typically 1- or 7-.
8. When naming ionic compounds in which variable oxidation states of metal ions are present, the oxidation state is shown in roman numerals.
> \$\text{Example: }\ce{FeCl2}\$
>
> $\require{color}\text{Iron has an oxidation state of 2+}$
>
> $\text{Therefore, the compound is called Iron } \colorbox{lightgray}{(II)} \text{ Chloride}$
9. When Hydrogen ($\ce{H2}$) is burned in Oxygen ($\ce{O2}$), water ($\ce{H2O}$) is formed

## Rates of Reaction
### Activation Energy $(E_a )$
- Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required to initiate a reaction
- Activation energy is measured in $kJ/mol$ [^1]
> $\color{green}k=Ae^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$
>
> $k:\text{Reaction Rate Coefficient}$
>
> $A:\text{Frequency Factor of the reaction}$
>
> $e:\text{Euler's Number (}e\text{ on calculator, approx. 2.7182)}$
>
> $R:\text{Universal Gas Constant}$
>
> $T:\text{Temperature }(K)$
- According to this equation, the rate of reaction increases with temperature
- However, there are some cases where the activation energy is negative, and so higher temperatures DECREASE the rate of reaction
#### Catalysis
- Catalysis is the process of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by introducing a *catalyst*
- A *catalyst* is any substance that lowers the activation energy of a reaction **WITHOUT MODIFYING THE PRODUCTS**
- Catalysts are not consumed by the reaction, and do not change the equilibrium constant of the reaction.
  - As a result, catalysts should be written in both the products and reactants of a chemical equation
  - Catalysts which *trigger* a reaction are known as **Activators**
- The SI unit for Catalysis is the **Katal** $(Kat)$
  
  > $ 1Kat=1mol/s $
- There are 3 main kinds of catalysts:
  - **Heterogenous Catalysts** are those which exist in a different phase from the reaction being catalyzed. For example, solid catalysts the catalyze a reaction in a mixture of liquids and/or gases are heterogeneous catalysts. Surface area is critical to the functioning of this type of catalyst.
  - **Homogenous Catalysts** exist in the same phase as the reactants in the chemical reaction. Organometallic catalysts are one type of homogeneous catalyst.
  - **Enzymes** are protein-based catalysts. They are one type of **biocatalyst**. Soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts, while membrane-bound enzymes are heterogeneous catalysts.
