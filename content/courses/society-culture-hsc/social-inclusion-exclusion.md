## Pluralism

- Pluralism is the concept of having multiple cultures or groups within a society.
- There is typically a strong sense of open dialogue and thorough understanding of the other cultures.
- Characteristics of a pluralist society include:
  - Recognition of other cultures
  - Harmonious
  - Engagement with diversity
  - Acceptance that traditional religions or belief systems aren't the only way a society can function

### Similarities and Differences between Individuals and Groups

| Similarities                                                 | Differences                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The representation of culture through symbols and artefacts  | Social differentiation within and between societies can be based on age/gender/sexuality/religion/disability/socio-economic status |
| A system of values/ethics (e.g. Sharia for Muslim people, Halachah for Jewish people, Canon Law for Christian people, Dharma for Hindu people) | Differences can also be created when meaning and emphasis are placed on certain things over others, or by certain groups. |
| Levels of organisation and hierarchy (e.g. priests<bishops<archbishops in Christianity) |                                                              |
| Language/Preferred method of communication (especially in prayer) |                                                              |
| Common beliefs                                               |                                                              |

### Socially Valued Resources (SVRs)

- SVRs are resources that *enable full and equal participation* in society
  - Expected/enjoyed by most members of society
  - Examples typically include housing, healthcare, education, the justice system, employment, etc.
- Social exclusion occurs when some groups have limited access to SVRs.
- Discrimination typically involves denial of an SVR to a group of people.
- SVRs are described and protected as a key component of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

### Micro/Meso - Social Exclusion in Australia

| Micro                                                        | Meso                                                         | Macro                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Social discrimination, usually based on race, religion, and/or gender. | Individual events, e.g. Cronulla Riots, hate crimes towards places of worship. | Systemic inequality as a component of Australian society: 76% students of non-European backgrounds have reported racism in a school environment that was not acted upon, 52% of Indigenous Australians reported incidents involving vulgar abuse in the workplace.[^1] |



## The Nature of Social Inclusion and Exclusion

- Social inclusion is inherent to an individual's ability to connect with friends, family, and their wider community.
- Social inclusion is strongest when people are equitably able to:
  - Find a stable job
  - Earn a livable income
  - Use the services provided by government equitably
  - Access legal and medical advice
  - Have their voices heard on a range of issues
- By creating opportunities for a diverse group of people to be included in a society, the quality of life for the majority of participants is improved.

- The ABS General Social Survey for 2010 reported positive attitudes towards people from different cultures, with 80% of
  people agreeing with the statement that ‘It is a good thing for a society to be made up of people from different
  cultures’.
- However, prior to COVID-19, there was already a significant downward trend in the social inclusion of people in Australia. From the 2019 ABS General Social Survey[^2]:

{{< callout note >}}

- Just over two-thirds (67.8%) of Australians had face to face contact with family or friends living outside their household at least once a  week.

  One in six Australians experienced some form of discrimination in the previous 12 months (17.4%).

  One in three (31.7%) people with a mental health condition and just over  one in five (22.1%) people with disability experienced some form of  discrimination.

  People who identified as gay, lesbian or  bisexual were more likely to report experiencing discrimination  than people who identified as heterosexual (33.5% compared to 16.9%).

  Just over one in ten Australians (11.0%) have been without a permanent place to live at some time in their lives.

  In 2019, nearly one in five households (19.5%) were unable to raise $2,000 within a week for something important.
