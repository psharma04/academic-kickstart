## The Pluralist Nature of Societies and Cultures

- Pluralism is the concept of having multiple cultures or groups within a society.
- There is typically a strong sense of open dialogue and thorough understanding of the other cultures.
- Characteristics of a pluralist society include:
  - Recognition of other cultures
  - Harmonious
  - Engagement with diversity
  - Acceptance that traditional religions or belief systems aren't the only way a society can function

### Similarities and Differences between Individuals and Groups

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The representation of culture through symbols and artefacts  | Social differentiation within and between societies can be based on age/gender/sexuality/religion/disability/socio-economic status |
| A system of values/ethics (e.g. Sharia for Muslim people, Halachah for Jewish people, Canon Law for Christian people, Dharma for Hindu people) | Differences can also be created when meaning and emphasis are placed on certain things over others, or by certain groups. |
| Levels of organisation and hierarchy (e.g. priests<bishops<archbishops in Christianity) |                                                              |
| Language/Preferred method of communication (especially in prayer) |                                                              |
| Common beliefs                                               |                                                              |
