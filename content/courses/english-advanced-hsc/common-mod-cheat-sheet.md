## Module Description

> In this common module students deepen their understanding of how texts represent individual and collective human experiences. They examine how texts represent human qualities and emotions associated with, or arising from, these experiences. Students appreciate, explore, interpret, analyse and evaluate the ways language is used to shape these representations in a range of texts in a variety of forms, modes and media.

> Students explore how texts may give insight into the anomalies, paradoxes and inconsistencies in human behaviour and motivations, inviting the responder to see the world differently, to challenge assumptions, ignite new ideas or reflect personally. They may also consider the role of storytelling throughout time to express and reflect particular lives and cultures. By responding to a range of texts they further develop skills and confidence using various literary devices, language concepts, modes and media to formulate a considered response to texts.

> Students study one prescribed text and a range of short texts that provide rich opportunities to further explore representations of human experiences illuminated in texts. They make increasingly informed judgements about how aspects of these texts, for example context, purpose, structure, stylistic and grammatical features, and form shape meaning. In addition, students select one related text and draw from personal experience to make connections between themselves, the world of the text and their wider world.

## Key Statements

| Key Statement                                                | What does it mean?                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Individual and Collective Human Experiences                  | An individual human experience is exclusive to 1 individual, whereas a collective experience is shared by multiple individuals |
| Human qualities and emotions associated with, or arising from, these experiences | The attributes, characteristics, and feelings connected to/caused by human experiences |
| Anomalies, Paradoxes, and Inconsistencies                    | Anomalies - Behaviours and motivations outside the norms and conventions of a particular social context<br />Paradoxes - Behaviours which conflict with the motivations<br />Inconsistencies: Behaviours and motivations which change despite no apparent cause |
| To see the world differently, to challenge assumptions, ignite new ideas or reflect personally | How the text influences the audience's way of thinking, whether by exposing them to novel ideas, challenging their pre-existing notions, or reinforcing their beliefs in an unsettling manner. |

## Dimensions of the Human Experience

The human experiences represented in your prescribed/unseen texts will always be connected to one of the subcategories of the "wellness wheel":

### Words to include in textual analysis

> These make markers happy for some reason.

- **Appreciate** - when making a judgement about the value of something
- **Explore** - when discussing the themes of the text
- **Interpret** - when discussing the audience's interaction with the text
- **Analyse** - When discussing your understanding of the text
- **Expression** - When discussing the author/poet/artist's connection to the text
- **Elicit** - When discussing how a technique results in an emotion

### Plutchik Wheel of Emotions 

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg" theme="light" >}}

## Essay Length

For paper 1 unseen texts, a good estimate is 2-3 lines per mark, while the extended response should be ~800 words/6 pages. If you don't hit those numbers, that's totally fine, it's just a good estimate.

### [RESOURCE: CHIPS Question Breakdown Strategy](https://hsc.one/talk/sor-short-responses-chips/)

4. How does the experience of the example present anomaly/paradox/inconsistency in the human experience?
5. What does the composer achieve?
