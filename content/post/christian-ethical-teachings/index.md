- Christian ethics provide a guide for Christians so that their daily living reflects scriptural principles and adheres to the principles of the faith
- Many elements of Christian ethics are based on the [Decalogue (Ten Commandments)<sup>{{< icon name="wikipedia-w" pack="fab" >}}</sup> ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments) and the [Beatitudes<sup>{{< icon name="wikipedia-w" pack="fab" >}}</sup> ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitudes)
- However, there are denominational differences:

  - Protestant ethics are primarily focused on the scripture itself
  - Catholics and Orthodox base their ethics on natural law (the idea that nature reflects God's will), and Church documents such as Papal Encyclicals and Apostolic Constitutions

## Key Principles
- Christian ethics has a heavy focus on God's will to "be done on Earth as it is in Heaven" [(Matthew 6:10 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:matt.6.10)
- These principles are the general outlines that are used for more specific or nuanced decisions
### Sanctity of Life
- All human life is considered sacred, as humans are made Imago Dei (In the image of God)
> "God created mankind in his own image,  in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them."
>
> [(Genesis 1:27 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:gen.1.27)
- God tasked humans with caring for his creation [(Genesis 2:15 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:gen.2.15)
- Since humans are created by God, and humans were tasked with caring for God's creation, then by extension, humans are responsible for the preservation of human life
### Divine Sovereignity of God
> Sovereignty: to have authority over an area or tract of land
- God is the creator of the entire universe [(Genesis 1:1 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:gen.1.1), including humanity [(Genesis 1:27 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:gen.1.27)
- Because he created all of humanity, he has authority and sovereignty over all humans as well

  - This is explained in [(Ephesians 1:11 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:eph.1.11):
  > "In Him we were made heirs, having been predestined according to the plan of Him, who works everything out in conformity with the purpose of His will,"
  - In other words: before birth, God has already planned out each individual's life "in conformity" with his greater plans for the universe
- This implies that if humans interfered with the start, quality and/or end of life, they would be disrupting God's plan and violating His sovereignty
### Jesus' Commandment of Love
- In the New Testament, Jesus teaches people to "Love one another as I have loved you" [(Ephesians 1:11 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:eph.1.11)
- Based on this, al ethical decisions in Christianity are rooted in the concept of love
- As well as loving your proverbial neighbor, Jesus also taught to "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and strength"[(Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV)<sup>{{< icon name="bible" pack="fas" >}}</sup>](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:deut.6.5)
