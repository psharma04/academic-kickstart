## Probability
- Probability measures the chance of an event taking place and ranges from zero (0) for an impossible event to one (1) for a certain event.
- The experimental probability of an event is based on the outcomes of experiments, simulations or surveys.
- A trial is a single experiment; for example, a single flip of a coin.
 $$\mathrm{Experimental Probability = \frac{Number Of Successful Trials}{Total Number Of Trials}}$$
- Complementary Events:
  - The COMPLEMENT of set A is all the elements of the Universal set that are not present in Set A
  - Written as A'
  - For example, the complement of a set containing all odd numbers would be a set containing all even numbers
