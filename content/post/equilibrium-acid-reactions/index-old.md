## Enthalpy Change

- Enthalpy (H) is a measure of the heat content of a system. Absolute enthalpy cannot be measured. However, the change in enthalpy (∆H): the change in the heat content of system during a process, measured at constant pressure.
$$\Delta H=H_{products}-H_{reactants}$$
- If $H_{products} \lt H_{reactants},$ $\Delta H$ is negative, so heat is *released* by the system **(exothermic)**
- If $H_{products} \gt H_{reactants},$ $\Delta H$ is positive, so heat is *absorbed* by the system **(endothermic)**

## Hess' Law of Heat Summation

> The total enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is **constant**, whether the reaction is performed in **one step** *or* **several steps.**

- Hess' Law is a consequence of the law of conservation of energy:

## Bond Energies

- Bond energy (or bond enthalpy) is the amount of energy required to **break one mole** of a bond in a **gaseous molecule**.

$$\Delta H_{rxn}=\sum{\Delta H_{\text{reactant bonds broken}}}+\sum{\Delta H_{\text{product bonds formed}}}$$

$$\Delta H_{rxn}=\sum{\Delta H_{\text{bond enthalpy of reactants}}}-\sum{\Delta H_{\text{bond enthalpy of products}}}$$

## Entropy

**Entropy (S)** is a measure of how **the available energy is distributed** amongst particles in a system. It is also a measure of energy dispersal (function of temperature). Generally, low entropy systems become high entropy over time (This is the principle of Chaos).

When energy can be **distributed in more ways in a system,** it is said to have greater entropy.

- Entropy is sometimes referred to as the measure of **disorder** or **randomness**

- A system with **greater possible arrangements (microstates** **Ω**)**, or **greater diversity of movement has higher entropy.

### Factors Which Affect Entropy

- Increasing the **number of particles** → Increases microstates → **Increase** entropy
- **Mixing** different types of particles → Increases microstates → **Increase** entropy
- Increasing the **volume** of a container of gas → Increases microstates → **Increases** entropy
  - The large rthe volume, the more ways there are to distribute the energy
- Increasing the number of particles in **states with more freedom of movement** (gas > liquid > solid)
- Molecules becoming **more complex** → Increases microstates → **Increases** entropy
- Increase **temperature** → Increases microstates → **Increases** entropy

### Second Law of Thermodynamics

1. The second law of thermodynamics states that the **entropy of the universe is always increasing**.
