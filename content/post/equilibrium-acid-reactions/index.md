## Chemical Systems

- **System** is the collective term for all substances involved in or affected by a chemical reaction
- The **surroundings** of a system are not changed by the reaction chemically, but may be affected by changed in energy, entropy, enthalpy, temperature, etc.
  - **Exothermic reactions** transfer energy from the system to the surroundings
  - **Endothermic reactions** transfer energy from the surroundings to the system

- Diagrams which show the energy changes that occur during a chemical reaction are known as **energy profile diagrams**

- The minimum amount of energy required before a reaction commences is known as its **activation energy** $(E_a)$
- An activation energy is present for both exothermic and endothermic reactions
  - However, exothermic reactions tend to have lower activation energies

### Enthalpy and Chemical Reactions

- The enthalpy change, $\Delta H,$ of a chemical reaction, is the heat (thermal energy) released or absorbed during the reaction
- Enthalpy change can be expressed as $\Delta H = H_{products} -H_{reactants}$
  - $\Delta H$ ia negative for for exothermic reactions, because heat is released from the system
  - $\Delta H$ is positive for endothermic reactions, because heat is absorbed by the system
- Enthalpy is a measure of energy per particle, so the SI unit is $J/mol \text{ (Base units: }\frac{kg\cdot m^2\cdot s^2}{mol}).$ However, $kJ/mol$ is also acceptable.

### Rates of Reaction

- The rate of a chemical reaction can be determined by measuring the change in concentration of the reactants and/or products over time
- The rate of reaction can be increased by:
  - Increasing concentration, surface area, and/or temperature
  - [Introducing a catalyst](https://schoolnotes.xyz/post/reactive-chemistry/#catalysis)

### Collision Theory

- According to collision theory, chemical reactions occur when reactant particles collide
- The likelyhood of successful collisions depends on:
  - The frequency of collisions. More collisions = more successful collisions.
  - The orientation of colliding particles. Particles oriented correctly will react, while particles oriented incorrectly will not.
  - Whether the energy of the collisions is greater than the activation energy. Collisions weaker than the activation energy will not react.

### Entropy and Gibbs Free Energy

- Entropy is the measure of disorder, or randomness, in a system

  > For example, mixing a bottle of blue paint with a bottle of yellow paint will (hopefully) produce green paint. 
  >
  > The blue and yellow paint had less randomness, because all the particles in each bottle were the same colour, but any particle in the green paint might be yellow or blue, and therefore the system is more random.

- According to the second law ot thermodynamics, the total entropy of a closed system always increases with time.

  > Let me know the next time you manage to unmix the paint.

- Entropy also increases when:
  - The volume of a gas/liquid increases
  - The number of particles increases
  - The temperature increases
  - The substance moves to a higher state (solid<liquid<gas<plasma)

### Open and Closed Systems

- A chemical reaction can be regarded as a system, with everything else in the universe referred to as its surroundings
- In an open system, matter and energy can be exchanged with the surroundings
- In a closed system, only energy can be exchanged with the surroundings



### Static and Dynamic Equilibrium

- Some reactions can be reversed.

  - For example, Nitrogen and Hydrogen can be combined to form Ammonia
  - However, ammonia will also decay into Nitrogen and Hydrogen

- These **reversible reactions** use the symbol $\ce{<=>}$ instead of the usual $\rightarrow$ or $\leftarrow$

  - In the case of nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia, the reaction is as follows:

  > $\ce{N2 +3H2 <=> 2NH3}$

  

- In an endothermic reaction, the activation energy for the forward reaction is much greater than the activation for the reverse reaction
- In an exothermic reaction, the activation for the reverse reaction is much greater than the activation energy for the forward reaction

- Reversible reactions can only occur in closed systems.
