## WARNING: 

* ### If you have medical conditions such as asthma or any sort of respiratory disease, you might want to keep your inhaler/medication on hand.
* ### CS spray and tear gas are the same thing. CS spray is just the technical shorthand (full name is 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile)

### 1) Get away from the gas.

### 2) Eyes: Rinse with clean water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contacts and DO NOT REUSE, wash glasses with soap and water

### 3) Breathing: Take deep breaths. Blow snot rockets as follows:

* Hold your index finger to the side of your nose a push one nostril shut.
* Lean your body to the side of your nose thatâ€™s open.
* Deep breath in.
* Close your mouth and forcefully blow out your nose.
* Repeat on the other side.

### 4) Rinse your mouth, preferably with milk or antacid. DO NOT SWALLOW!!!

### 5) Clothing: remove any clothing covered in CS

* Avoid removing clothing or jewellery over your head, cut it off if possible
* Wash your body with soap and cool water (Warm water dilates pores so the gas will get deeper in and burn more) for about 20 minutes

### 6) Cleaning: 

* Wash contaminated clothing separately from the rest of your laundry. 
* Clean any jewellery with soap and water. 
* DO NOT use any detergent containing Chlorine Bleach (Chlorine bleach and CS gas can form Chlorine dioxide, a highly dangerous neurotoxin.)

# If you follow all of these steps, the worst will be over in half an hour.
