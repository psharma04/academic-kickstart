## Periodic Table
- The periodic table is a table listing the fundamental building blocks of the universe: elements
- NOTE: ATOM and ELEMENT do NOT mean the same thing!
  - An atom is a particle containing protons and electrons (and generally neutrons too)
  - An element is a substance made out of the SAME TYPE OF ATOM
  - An atom is the smallest sample of an element.
- Atoms have a nucleus (which contains their protons and neutrons) and orbiting shells (which contain electrons in fixed rings)
- Electron shells fill from the innermost available space:
  - The first shell can hold a MAXIMUM of 2 electrons
  - The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons
  - The third shell can hold 8 electrons until the fourth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)

<summary>    This concept is a bit confusing at first. Click here to see how it works </summary>
      - In the fourth period, Potassium has an electron configuration of Potassium is  $ 2,8,8,1 $
      - Calcium is  $ 2,8,8,2 $
      - Scandium is  $ 2,8,9,2 $ . After the 4th shell has 2 electrons, they begin to fill from the 3rd shell until Zinc, which fills the third shell to its capacity of 18 ( $ 2,8,18,2 $ ).
      - After Zinc, electrons fill the outermost shell again until Krypton ( $ 2,8,18,8 $ ), after which the fifth shell starts filling.
      - This trend occurs for shells 3/4 and 4/5.

  - The fourth shell can hold 8 electrons until the fifth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)

### Memorising the first 20 elements
- There is an easy way to memorise the first 20 elements, the Periodic Table Song
- You should memorise up to the first chorus (including the chorus) for Year 10 Chemistry. Year 11 and 12 Chemistry may require more.

### Representing Atoms
- There are several ways to represent an atom.
  - The first way is the atom's symbol.
  - The atomic symbol is the one or two letter shortcode for the atom that can be seen on the periodic table.
![Image of the Periodic Table](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg)
  - For example, Oxygen is represented as  $ O $ , while Calcium is  $ Ca $
  - The first letter MUST be capital and the second letter (if present) MUST be lowercase.  $ ca $ ,  $ CA $  or  $ cA $  for Calcium are all INCORRECT answers.
  - Some elements have atomic symbols which somewhat match their name, such as  $ N $  for Nitrogen
  - Others seem completely random, such as  $ Au $  for Gold. These tend to come from their Latin names ("Aurum" in the case of Gold)
- Another way is by writing out the ELECTRON CONFIGURATION.
  - This is the filling order of the electron shells.
  - For example, Hydrogen is  $ 1 $ , Oxygen is  $ 2,6 $ , etc.
  - This method is not often used for naming an element, since electron configurations can change in Chemical Reactions.

## Chemical Reactions
- A chemical reaction is when the bonds between atoms are broken, formed or changed
- A chemical reaction has 2 parts: reactants and products
  - Reactants are the substances BEFORE the reaction
  - Products are the substances AFTER the reaction
### Law Of Conservation Of Mass
- The Law of Conservation of Mass states that:
<blockquote>Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.</blockquote>
- This means that in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products MUST be the same as the total mass of the reactants.
- For example, photosynthesis:
  - 6CO2 + 6H2O â€”> C6H12O6 + 6O2
  - On both sides of the equation, there are:
    - 6 Carbon atoms
    - 6 Oxygen atoms
    - 12 Hydrogen atoms
  - This is known as a BALANCED EQUATION
### Law of Constant Proportions
- The Law of Constant Proportions states that:
- <blockquote>A given chemical compound always contains its components in a fixed ratio.</blockquote>

- For example, in water, there will ALWAYS be two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom (H2O).
  - If there were an equal number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, then the substance would not be Water (H2O), instead it would be Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2).
### Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
- An EXOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that GENERATES heat/energy (exo-: outside, -thermic: heat)
- An ENDOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that REQUIRES heat/energy (endo-: inside, -thermic: heat)
- Sometimes, exothermic reactions require heat to start. However, their total energy output is GREATER than the total energy input
### Ionic and Covalent Bonds
- An IONIC bond is a bond between oppositely charged IONS (atoms with an unequal number of protons and electrons)
- Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal
- One atom will LOSE electrons, and the other will GAIN electrons so that both have a filled outer shell.
- For example, in  $ NaCl $ , The Sodium atom loses an electron and the Chlorine atom gains that electron. The two atoms are then electrostatically attracted together.
- A COVALENT bond is a bond where two non-metal atoms SHARE a pair of valence electrons
- An atom can have multiple covalent bonds. For example, carbon group atoms can have up to four covalent bonds
- Noble Gases (group 18) do NOT form bonds with anything (except in rare circumstances)
- Two atoms with a covalent bond can be said to be DIATOMIC

### Element Groupings
- The periodic table has several methods of being divided into categories.
- The first method is by PERIOD
  - Elements in horizontal rows are in the same period.
  - Each at the end of each period, the next electron shell begins to fill.
- The second method is by BLOCK
  - Each block of the periodic table is determined by the electron orbitals which are filled in that block.
  - Each block is named after the orbital which gets filled in that block

  - The s-block is everything in columns 1 and 2, as well as Helium
  - The d-block is everything from column 3 to 12, except the Lanthanides and Actinides
  - The p-block is everything from column 13 onwards, except Helium
  - The f-block is the Lanthanides and Actinides
- The third method is by GROUP
  - Vertical columns of the Periodic Table are known as GROUPS
  - Elements in the same group have similar properties
    - Group 1: Alkaline Metals
    - Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals
    - Group 3-12: Transition Metals
    - Group 13: Boron Group
    - Group 14: Carbon Group
    - Group 15: Pnictogens
    - Group 16: Chalcogens
    - Group 17: Halogens
    - Group 18: Noble Gases
