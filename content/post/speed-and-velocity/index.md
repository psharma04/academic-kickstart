- Average Speed: distance travelled per unit of time (m/s)
- Velocity: displacement per unit of time (m/s)
- Average Speed is SCALAR, while velocity is a VECTOR
## Distance-Speed-Time Triangles

- Usage:
  - Average Speed \\(=\\) Distance \\(\div\\) Time
  - Distance \\(=\\) Average Speed \\(\times\\) Time
  - Time \\(=\\) Distance \\(\div\\) Average Speed
## Acceleration
- Acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity CHANGES
- Acceleration is measured in \\(m/s^2\\) (metres per second squared)
- Acceleration can be found by dividing the applied force by the mass of the object
  - \\(a = F/m\\)

- Acceleration is a VECTOR quantity.
