## Talmud
- A legal commentary on the TaNaKh, explaining how its commandments are to be lived out
- Consists of two books
  - Mishnah
  - Gemara
- The Mishnah is the Oral Law. It includes lessons and quotations from sages, scholars and rabbis.
- The Mishnah is organised as a legal book, while the Torah is arranged like a narrative
- The Gemara contains the Halachah (Jewish Law)
- The Mishnah is the Core Text of the Talmud, while the Gemara serves as an expansion, "completing" the Talmud
- Both texts explore the reasoning behind the principles of the Torah, as well as situations where an action might not be considered a violation of Mitzvot.
- They also serve as a final legal ruling on contradictions in the Torah, providing a definitive answer to issues of conflict.
