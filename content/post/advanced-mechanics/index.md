## Projectile Motion

- A **projectile** is an object that is thrown or *projected* into the air and is **moving freely** (has no source of thrust)
- Examples of projectiles include a thrown tennis ball, a cricket ball hit with a bat, an arrow fired from a bow, or a person skydiving
- A projectile's flight is known as **Ballistic Flight**
- Ballistic flight takes the shape of a Parabola
- Gravity is the only force which is considered to act on a projectile
- Ballistic flight can be analysed using Newton's laws of motion, and the [equations of rectilinear motion](/post/kinematics/#suvat-equations)

Key points:

- Gravity is the only force which acts on a projectile
- To use SUVAT or Newton's Laws, projectiles must be:
  - Larger than $1mm$ in diameter
  - Travelling at less than $0.01x$ the speed of light $(0.01c)$
- Projectile flight paths take the shape of a [parabola](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jrqwxwspif)
- The horizontal velocity of a projectile is **constant** throughout its flight $(u_{x}=v_{x})$

### Projectiles in freefall

- By definition, a projectile has no force affecting its horizontal motion after it is launched (remember, we ignore air resistance in physics)
- Since the only force acting on the projectile is gravity, which provides an equal acceleration at every point of flight, the object deviates from its straight horizontal path throughout its flight, until it collides with the ground
- Projectiles can be launched at any angle. The launch velocity must be resolved into vertical and horizontal components using $sin/cos/tan$ in order to solve most questions

> NOTE: a diagram tends to help with these questions. Also, splitting vectors into their components (such as the force diagram below) makes your life MUCH easier.

The Effect of Drag

- While mathematical questions usually don't include drag (also known as air resistance), a lot of the written questions for projectile motions expect you to mention it.
- The magnitude of drag depends on 4 factors:
  - Speed - drag is proportional to speed squared
  - Cross-section - drag is proportional to cross-section
  - The aerodynamic shape - certain shapes (such as a teardrop) are more aerodynamic than others, so objects with those shapes have less drag
  - Air density - drag is proportional to the density of the air
- Because drag and velocity are proportional, there is a velocity at which drag and gravitational acceleration reach equilibrium, and the projectile has no net acceleration
- The point where drag and gravitational acceleration are equal is known as **terminal velocity**

### Oblique Projectiles (projectiles launched at an angle)

- Projectiles launched obliquely (at an angle) have their vectors split into components along the x- and y- axes 
- Some of these components have specific names when used in projectile motion
  - For example, displacement $(s)$ is referred to as height in vertical motion $(h=s_{y}),$ and range in horizontal motion $(r=s_x)$
