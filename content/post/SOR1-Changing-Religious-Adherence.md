## Christianity as the Major Religious Tradition
- Since 1947, the patterns of religious adherence have been steadily changing, as shown in the Australian census
- The First Fleet established Christianity (specifically Anglicanism and, to some extent, Catholicism) in Australia in 1788
- As a result, most of the laws of Australia are based in Christian ethics and teachings
- The White Australia policy meant that most migrants were from Europe, which is predominantly Christian
  - Anglicanism is mostly common in England, while the rest of Western Europe tends to be Catholic
  - As a result, the balance of Christian denominations in Australia shifted towards a predominantly Catholic community
  - Some Orthodox Christians also came to Australia due to political instability in Eastern Europe
- The percentage of Christian adherents has decreased since 1947, steadily falling.
 - 1961 - 88.4%
 - 1986 - 74.1%
 - 2016 - 52%

- The fall in Christian adherence is attributed to an increase in people turning away from religion, as well as migration from Asia and the Middle East
### Formation of the Uniting Church
- The Uniting Church was formed as a result of the decline of adherents for three Christian denominations
  - Presbytarians
  - Methodists
  - Congregationalists
- Peaked in 1986 at 7.6% of Australians
- Due to an older adherent base, Uniting Church adherence has declined in recent years

## Rise of New-Age Religions
- New-Age religions are a group of spiritual practices/beliefs developed in Western society from the 1970s and onwards
- New-Age Religions tend to be ECLECTIC (ideas/beliefs which come from a wide range of sources)
  - Eclectic religions take elements from other religions, as well as philosophies, sciences and other sources in order to create a system which they believe is better suited to their community
- Formed as a reaction against the percieved failure of traditional religious (such as Christianity), and the failure of Secular Humanism to provide spiritual and ethical guidance for the future
  - Secular Humanism: a philosophy or life stance that embraces human reason, non-religious ethics, and philosophical naturalism while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, and superstition as the basis of morality and decision making.
- Beliefs of New Age religions include:
  - Monism: All that exists is derived from a single source of divine energy
  - Pantheism: God is everything that exists, God is at once the entire universe, and transcends the universe as well
  - Reincarnation: After death, we are reborn and live another life as a human. This cycle repeats itself many times
  - Karma: The good and bad deeds that we do adds and subtracts from our accumulated record, our karma.
- New Age Practices include:
 - Channeling: A method similar to that used by Spiritists in which a spirit of a long dead individual is conjured up.has existed since the 1850's and many groups consider themselves independent of the New Age movement.
 - Crystals: Crystals are materials big rocks which has its molecules arranged in a specific, highly ordered internal pattern.
 - Meditating: A process of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking.
 - New Age Music: A gentle, melodic, inspirational music form involving the human voice, harp, lute, flute, etc. It is used as an aid in healing, massage therapy and general relaxation.

## Secularism
- The belief that religion should not interfere with public affairs
- Caused by changing social standards, resulting in the decrease in percieved relevance of religious traditions
- Rise of pluralism (differing political standpoints within society), materialism and individualism
- Most evident through the increase of "No Religion" in the Census

## Immigration
- Immigration has caused a major shift for religion in Australia since 1947
- The first wave of immigration after World War 2 resulted in the establishment of a Jewish population in Australia, as well as an increase in Orthodox and Catholic people, but a decrease in Anglicanism
- The second wave of immigration came from Asia and the Middle East
  - Stemmed from a fear of communism, as well as wars such as the Vietnam War, Cambodian Civil War, etc.
  - Saw an increase in Islam and the establishment of Buddhism
  - Decrease in Anglicanism
  - Formation of the Uniting Church
- The third wave of immigration is a result of war, famine and terrorism
  - Caused by events such as the Gaza War, rise of Al Qaeda and Islamic State
  - Increase in Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism
  - Total drop of over 30% in Christianity

*   Protestants are most likely to switch denominations because they believe that the Bible is subjective, and are therefore able to interpret the nature of passages in their own way
    *   Because of this, they can switch to a denomination that better suits their beliefs
*   Catholics and Orthodox Christians are less likely to switch because they are more static in their beliefs
    *   The Bible is considered a complete, objective and unchanging document and therefore they have not changed over the last 1500 years
*   10% of all people who took part in the survey changed denominations in the past five years (between 2010 and 2015)
    *   This increased to 17% when only surveying Protestants
*   Pentecostalism is the fastest growing denomination (220000 in 2006 to 260500 in 2016)

<blockquote>People no longer remain in a particular denomination simply because their parents and grandparents belonged to it or because they share the same ethnic background with other church members. </blockquote>
