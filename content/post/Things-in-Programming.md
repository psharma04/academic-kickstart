## Types of Things in Programming
-	Variables – Stored data
-	Functions – code that does stuff
-	Loops – A function that runs when its conditions are met
## Variables:
-	There are 6 important types of variables:
  - Integers – Any whole number
	- Floats – Floating point number, any decimal
  -	Null – No value (NOT THE SAME AS 0)
	- Chars – Single characters, can be letters or numbers
  -	Boolean – True/False
  -	String – Anything that doesn’t fit into the above categories. ALWAYS has to be enclosed in quote marks
-	Variables tend to be created with the following structure:
	 - <type> <name> = <value>
   -	For example: int hello = 5
   -	Create an integer named “hello” that has the value of 5
   -	If the command value(hello) is called, the interpreter will return 5
-	NOTE: VARIABLE NAMES CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES!!!
## Functions
-	Commands that do things, for example:
	- echo/log/print to print text
  -	add(1,2) will compute 1+2 and return 3
  -	Functions are specific to programming languages
  -	Functions can also be created using def(), func() or function()
  	- For Example:
<blockquote>def hello_world(): <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(“Hello world!”) </blockquote>
    - Would generate the output:
<blockquote>Hello world!</blockquote>
## Loops
-	Loops are functions that execute if their conditions are met
-	Types of loops include:
	 - If loops: IF Condition is met, do XYZ
   - While loops: WHILE Condition is met, do XYZ
   - For loops: iterates over a sequence
    - Example: for every letter in string(“banana”), add 1 to int(number_of_letters)
      - Will result in int(number_of_letters) to equal 6
-	Loops can be nested inside one another.
