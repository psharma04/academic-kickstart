### Force

* A force can be thought of as a push or a pull
* A force that acts by being directly in contact with an object is known as a *contact force*

  * Friction and drag are both contact forces
* A force that acts on an object at a distance is called a *non-contact force* or a force mediated by a field
* The unit of force is the Newton (N)

  * 1 Newton is the force exerted when holding 100g mass against the downward pull of gravity
* If more than one force is acting on an object, the vector sum is known as the *net force*

  * \(\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + ... \vec{F}_n\)
* The net force for a stationary object, or one that is moving at a constant velocity, is \(0\), also known as *equilibrium*
* The net force for an object that is speeding up, slowing down or changing direction is \(\neq 0\)

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law

> Every object will maintain a constant velocity unless an unbalanced external force acts on it.

* Newton's first law means that if an object has no forces acting on it, then it will continue to travel at its current speed and direction until an unbalanced net force acts on it ![Diagram of Newton's First Law](/images/kinematics-1.jpg)
* Newton's first law is closely related to the concept of *Inertia*, the tendency of an object to resist any changes in motion
* This resistance is related to the mass of the object, with more massive objects having a greater inertia

  * The result of this is that to cause the same amount of change in motion, the amount of force increases proportionally to the amount of mass. This relationship is Newton's second law

### Second Law

> \(\vec{F}=m \vec{a}\) \(\vec{F}=Force (Newtons)\) \(m=Mass (kilograms)\) \(\vec{a}=Acceleration (m/s^2)\)

* The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. Therefore: ![Newton's second law triangle](/images/newtons-second-law-triangle.png)
* \(1N = 1kg \times m/s^2\)
* As a result, more force on the same mass means a greater acceleration, and an equal force on less mass also means a greater acceleration
* Newton's Laws of Motions are all subject to vector addition and subtraction

### Third Law

> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction \(\vec{F}\_\text{AB}=-\vec{F}\_{\text{BA}}\)

* If object A pushes on object B with \(x\) Newtons of force, object B will push back on object A with \(x\) Newtons of force
* \(\vec{F}\_\text{AB}\) and \(\vec{F}\_{\text{BA}}\) are known as an *action-reaction pair*

  > Newton's third law only applies to forces acting on different objects

### The Normal Force

* When a smaller object (object A) falls under the influence of a force (such as gravity) from a larger object (the Earth), the effective force on object A is easy to observe
* The action force is the gravitational force of the Earth being exerted on object A
* In this case, ignoring air resistance, object A will accelerate downward at \(9.8m/s^2\)
* If object A is then placed at rest on the floor, the gravitational force \(\vec{F}=m\vec{g}\) is still acting on it, but it is at rest
* According to Newton's first law, an object can only be at rest if all the forces acting on it are balanced, so there must be a force counteracting gravity
* This is known as the *normal force* \((\vec{F}_N)\) ![The normal force is perpendicular to the surfaces in contact](/images/normal-force-1.png) ![If there is no contact between the objects, there is no normal force](/images/normal-force-2.png)
* The normal force acts with the same magnitude as its reactant force, but perpendicular TO THE SURFACE THE OBJECT IS ON (this will be an important distinction later)
* It is important to note that the normal force and the reaction force from the third law are NOT THE SAME!!!

  * This is because the normal force and its opposite act on the same object, while Newton's third law acts on two different objects
* Weight and the normal force do not make up an action-reaction pair, because they both act on the same object

### The Inclined Plane

* In previous examples of the normal force, the surface has been horizontal. However, an object can be placed on a surface that is tilted at angle \(\theta\) to the horizontal
* Even on a tilted surface, \(\vec{F}=m\vec{g}\) still acts downwards
* However, the normal force acts at right angles to the SURFACE, and will change in magnitude according to the following formula:

  > \(\vec{F}_N=m\vec{g}\cdot cos\theta\)
* THe motion of the object will then be affected by friction, if it is present
* The component of the weight force that acts ALONG THE SURFACE is given by

  > \(\vec{F}=m\vec{g}\cdot sin\theta\)
