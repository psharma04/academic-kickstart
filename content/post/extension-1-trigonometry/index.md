## Unit Circle
- From advanced mathematics, you may remember the unit circle [^1]. This will be important for this module.

## Sum-Difference Identities
### Cosine
> $\cos(A\pm B)=\cos (A)\cos (B)\mp\sin (A)\sin (B)$
{{% alert info %}}
If you aren't familiar with $\mp,$ it works like this:
1. If the $\pm$ is a plus, then the $\mp$ is a minus
2. If the $\pm$ is a minus, then the $\mp$ is a plus
So the cosine rule can be broken into 2 parts:
  > $\cos(A+B)=\cos (A)\cos (B)-\sin (A)\sin (B)$
  >
  > $\text{and}$
  >
  > $\cos(A-B)=\cos (A)\cos (B)+\sin (A)\sin (B)$

#### Proof for cosine sum-difference identity
- Consider 2 points ($P$ and $Q$) on the unit circle
- Point $P$ is at an angle $\alpha$ from the positive x-axis with coordinates $(\sin (\alpha), \cos(\alpha)),$
- Point $Q$ is at an angle of $\beta$ from the positive x-axis, with coordinates $(\sin (\beta), \cos(\beta))$
> If this hard to visualise, a diagram is coming.
