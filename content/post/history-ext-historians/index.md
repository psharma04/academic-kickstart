## The Purpose of the Historical Record

### Herodotus - The Histories

> “to preserve the memory of the past by putting on record the astonishing achievements”

- *His purpose was to record the memory of great deeds to tell a story.*

- *Aim was to PRESERVE the memories of people in his own class and discover the origins of conflict – Greece and Asia.*

> *“So that means past may not fade into oblivion overtime nor the great amazing deeds displayed by frees and barbarians be remembered with renown.”*

- **Herodotus' *The Histories* was meant for oral recitation.**
- *He saw the importance of recording past events – primary the major conflict of the time. The deep impact of the event was important for both civilisations involved, as well as explaining why it was they were fighting – IMPERIALISM.*
- *PRESERVE - ... “to preserve the memory of the past by putting on record the astonishing achievements”*
- *All stories had a powerful moral lesson – a divine purpose.* 

### Thucydides - History of the Peloponnesian War

- Purpose: To be objective

- He sought to find the truth behind what happened in particular events, this can be seen especially in the Peloponnesian war; he believed it was important to find the truth behind this event.

- Attempted to reveal the true nature of humans, especially when in danger.

>  *“I have written work, not as an essay which is to win applause of to win the applause of the moment, but as a possession for all time”* 
>
> – Thucydides

- **When providing two contrasting testimonies and to explain the inferences he made, he was also prepared on some occasions to leave the explanations up to the audience.*
-  Intended to tell the truth about the Peloponnesian War as it was important to do so.

- He did not think that accumulating of facts was a good enough method, instead attempting to provide explanations for events

### Polybius - The Histories

- Not about entertainment. Practical and instructive purpose. Provide guidance in military and political matters. 

- Designed to teach a lesson, not entertain or inform.(Didactic)

> *“There can surely be nobody so petty or so apathetic in his outlook that he has no desire to discover by what means and under what system of government the Romans succeeded in less than fifty-three years in bringing under their rule almost the whole of the inhabited world, an achievement that is without parallel in human history.”*

> \- Polybius

- He believed history had a practical, instructive purpose and could provide military and political guidance.

- Believed that the historical record could help people cope with moral problems and face whatever changing fortunes occur: 

> “It is History which…will mature our judgement and prepare us to take right views.

- Believed in getting into the heart of the past, linking the chains of what causes an event.

- *Saw moral lessons to be learned about how men react to challenge and adversity.*

### The Venerable Bede - Ecclesiastical History

- Instruction of posterity. Aimed to provide a manual for rulers to govern aims of the classical historians, and spread the correct teachings of the Gospel.

- He says he was writing for the instruction of posterity, but unlike classical historians in aim of spreading the correct teaching of the Gospel.

- Extremely evangelical

- To guide the pagan to the true faith and help believers grow in their Christian faith

> “For if history records good things of good men, the thoughtful hearer is encouraged to imitate what is good; or if it records evil of wicked men, the devout, religious listener or reader is encouraged to avoid all that is sinful and perverse and to follow what he knows to be good and pleasing to God.”
>
> \- The Venerable Bede

### Edward Gibbon - The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

- **PURPOSE:** *To teach simple lessons and provide guides for future behaviour.*

> *“To challenge, provoke, engage and encourage the readers to consider his views on the nature of civilisation and how it could and should progress through the curbing of priest ridden superstition”* 
>
> \- Gibbon

- Attempted to reflect his own personal and philosophical beliefs, especially his views on religion

- Related his opinions and arguments to the 18th century concerns.

### Macaulay - The History of England from the Ascension of James II

- **PURPOSE:** *To prove certainty.*

- ‘This is how things were, trust me, I’m a historian’

- Identified the events, people and ideas that assisted the development of England and praise said contributors, likewise condemn those who hindered it

- Teleological in the sense that he wanted to relate the inevitable journey towards parliamentary democracy
