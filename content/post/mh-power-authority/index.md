## Context of 1919



*   Allies had won a long, hard-fought war of attrition against the Central Powers.
*   Allied leaders under pressure from their people to punish Germany, pressure to make Germany pay for all damage caused by the war.
*   Economies were in ruin/collapse → civilians faced food/fuel shortages beyond 1918.
*   Millions of men killed/injured.
*   British Election Campaigns → politicians knew they could rely on British public’s vote if they demanded revenge on Germany.

## The Nazi Regime until 1939

##### The rise of the Nazi party and Hitler in Germany, and the collapse of the Weimar Republic .

### Congenital Defects in the Weimar Republic (1918-1919)



*   The shock of defeat and deception of the German people during the war → Dolchstosslegende and November Criminals →  distaste for the republic.
*   5 January 1919 – Spartacist revolution began (Communism v. Democracy).
    *   Leads to division between Ebert & Left Wing and unison between Ebert & Right Wing.
*   Ebert & Groener Pact → Ebert asks Groener (army general) to protect the republic in case of communist revolution. The Army is connected with Conservative Elites who are anti-democracy.
    *   Groener sends Freikorps →  brutally suppress Spartacists.
    *   Divides the left wing and solidifies the power of the army and the conservative elites.
*   Constitutional Faults
    *    Article 22
        *   Proportional Representation – any small extreme parties can get a seat in the Reichstag.
        *    Forced to form coalition governments between Right & Left wing – this doesn’t work – leads to political instability.
    *    Article 25
        *   President can replace the Reichstag whenever they want, 7 year term
    *   Article 48 “Suicide Clause”
        *   If there is a ‘state of emergency’, the President can suspend democracy for a time and rule by decree.
*   Treaty of Versailles
    *   Debilitates Germany

### Years of Challenge in the Weimar Republic (1920-1924)



*   Hyperinflation due to War Reparations and occupation of the Ruhr.
*   Threats from the Right Wing
    *   Army becoming a state within a state.
    *   Kapp Putsch
        *   Right Wing uprising
        *   The Army refused to suppress revolutionists as they were on the same side.
        *   Ebert’s government is forced to flee.
    *   Occupation of the Ruhr
        *   Workers strike
        *   Hyperinflation
        *   Stresemann becomes chancellor and saves the republic and ends hyperinflation.
    *   Munich Beer Hall Putsch

### Golden Years of the Weimar Republic (1925-1929)



*   Prosperity and growth for Weimar Republic
*   Gustav Stresemann held the foreign minister position from 1923-1929.
    *   Expresses a policy of fulfilment – fulfilling the Treaty of Versailles → angers the conservative elites.
    *   Recovers the German economy.
        *   Dawes Plan & Young Plan – both reliant on the US economy.
    *   Political Stability
        *   SPD dominates the Reichstag.
*   Still significant issues lying in the constitution.
*   Proportional representation made coalitions necessary.
*   Hindenburg was elected President in 1925. 
*   Treaty of Locarno – Germany making friends – invited back to the international community.

### Collapse of the Weimar Republic (1929-1933)

*   The Great Depression killed the Weimar Republic.
    *   Stresemann’s economic plans had Germany’s money tied up in American loans.
    *   Unemployment rates skyrocketed - crash in economy → 6million unemployed in 1930.
    *   Wall Street Crash October 1929
    *   Collapse of Danat bank.
*   Conservative manipulate the public as they are still in power due to the Ebert-Groener Pact.
*   Hindenburg advises Muller to utilise Article 48, which allows democracy to be disabled in a ‘state of emergency’.
    *   Hitler was then invited to become Chancellor of Germany in 1933.
*   TIMELINE OF COLLAPSE:
    *   1930: Muller wants to employ Unemployment Benefit Scheme and is denied employing Article 48 by Hindenburg and in turn is forced to resign. Bruning is appointed chancellor – rigid policy of deflation using Article 48 but fails to ameliorate the effects of the Great Depression.
    *   1932: Von Papen becomes chancellor (Baron’s Cabinet full of conservative elites). He fails to fix the depression and is then replaced by Von Schleicher. Von Papen goes to Hindenburg and suggests that Hitler’s party should be in power, and that Hitler will be a ‘chancellor in chains’.
    *   1933: Hitler appointed as Chancellor.

   <td>RACIAL IDEOLOGY
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>The notion that German greatness and the harmony of the Volksgemeinschaft were constantly under threat from jealous, evil, racially inferior groups, in particular the Jews and Slavic peoples on Germany’s eastern borders

<li>The Aryan race was superior to all other races. Slavs and Jews were subhuman or Untermensch. 

<li>Hitler believed that living space, or lebensraum for the German racially superior would be needed in the East of Europe at the expense of lower races.

<li>Hitler’s anti-Semitism was more a product of the immediate post WWI period.

<li>Notions of racial struggle and anti-Semitism became the cornerstone of Nazi ideology as it emerged in the 1920’s. 

<li>Lebensraum → living space in the east.

<li>Survival of the fittest.

<li>All humans are subject to natural selection.

<li>Idea of a ‘superior’ race. 
<ul>

<li>Aryan Race
</li> 
</ul>

<li>Elimination of all ‘weak’ members of society, e.g. Jews, the disabled, homosexuals and other undesirables.

<li>Argued that some races were inherently superior to others and would prosper at the expense of those inferior races.

<li>Hitler believed that the life of the nation was one of permanent and continuing struggle for survival, in which the strongest race was destined to come out on top – so long as its purity remained intact.

**SUMMARY OF OPPOSITION:**



*   The effectiveness of the Nazi’s terror campaign drove left-wing groups like the German Communist Party and the German Socialist Party either to flee the country or form underground networks.
    *   Both groups tried to politicise Germany’s workers but repression under the Gestapo undermined the effectiveness of any opposition.
*   Youth groups such as the Edelweiss Pirates, the Blasen, the Meuten and the Swing Movement engaged in localised violence and general social deviance, which proved to be more of an annoyance than a threat to the regime.
*   Both the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church spoke out against Nazi policies that affected them or their core teachings directly but were silent in the face of the regime’s anti-Semitic actions.
*   The High Command of the German Army had the potential to overthrow Hitler.
    *   However, they did not attempt to do this until the war had begun → after the war began to turn against Germany.
*   Many brave individuals stood up and opposed the Nazi regime, often losing their lives for their efforts, e.g. Josef Romer, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Georg Elser. 

## The Search for Peace and Security in the Modern World

##### The ambitions of Germany in Europe and Japan in the Asia-Pacific

### Germany in Europe



*   Aims:
    *   Revisionism
        *   Revising the Treaty of Versailles with focus on nationalism and militarism.
    *   Lebensraum
        *   Living space in the East
        *   Enslave the Slavs
    *   Reuniting Germanic speaking people.
        *   Grossdeustchland
*   Actions:
    *   Attempts to prevent attack from Britain, Russia etc. by making peace treaties that he doesn’t have the intention of keeping.
    *   Leads to the miscalculation that Hitler was non-aggressive – policies of appeasement.
    *   The actions Hitler took seemed to deviate from his core ideology, however they were merely a means to an end of achieving his aims.
*   Hitler’s ambitions were to restore German military strength, unite all Germans, achieve self-sufficiency, revise the Treaty of Versailles, unite all German speaking people (Grossdeustchland) and achieve Lebensraum.
*   Policy of appeasement: Hitler withdrew from League of Nations
    *   Rearm Germany. Occupied the Rhineland, and claim Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia(to ‘free’ 3 million oppressed Germans, and use Skoda Works)
*   23 August 1939: Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact
    *   Gave Germany permission to invade Poland to avoid repeat of two-front war
    *   This invasion marked the beginning of WWII.

### Japan in the Asia-Pacific

*   Japan fought in WWI alongside the Allies, was rewarded with a mandate of Pacific colonies - however was not considered equal to the Big Four
*   The Washington and London Naval Treaties further exacerbated resentment as it created political opposition within Japan
*   Growing belief that Japanese domination in South-East Asia was essential to self-sufficiency and security
*   September 1931: Invasion of Manchuria (China) established the puppet state of Manchukuo
    *   1937 Marco Polo Bridge incident
*   Expansion into French Indochina was met with embargoes from the US
*   In response, Japan attacked the US naval base in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii and further expanded into South-East Asia.

### The intentions and authority of the League of Nations and the United Nations

#### League of Nations



*   Relied on the concept of collective security
*   Introduced by US President Woodrow Wilson, and stated in the TOV
*   There was still tension between countries, overpowering nationalism rather than militarism and no military force
*   US Senate rejected American membership in the League to preserve their isolationist policy
*   League failed to intervene and prevent 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, 1935 Italian Invasion of Abyssinia and 1936 Spanish Civil War
*   Ultimately lacked authority and failed in its objectives.

#### United Nations

*   Moscow Declaration: concept that developed throughout the war for the Allies to establish a new international organisation of peace and security
*   Came into existence 24 October 1945, and is ultimately controlled by Britain, France, Russia, US and China.
*   Faced problems with tensions between East and West during the Cold War.
*   First 3 years, Soviet Union used its veto power 30 times.
*   Brought Arab-Israeli War to an end.
