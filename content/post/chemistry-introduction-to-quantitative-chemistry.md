## Stoichiometry
- Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry which deals with the calculation of quantities involved in chemical reactions
- This includes the masses and volumes of substances
## Patterns in Chemical Reactions
### Decomposition Reactions
- Decomposition reactions involve breaking down one compound into 2 or more simpler substances
- Decomposition is an ENDOTHERMIC reaction, meaning it reuqires heat input
- An example of a decomposition reaction is carbonate decomposition:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{CuCO_3}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{CuO+CO_2}\\)
>
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Green: Reactants}}\\)
>
> \\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Light Blue: Products}}\\)
#### Decomposition by light
- Some compounds will decompose when exposed to light
- An example is Silver Nitrate (\\(AgNO_3\\)):
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{AgNO_3}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{2Ag + 2NO_2 +O_2 }\\)
- Light-based decomposition is the basis of film photography
### Combustion Reactions
- Combustion reactions occur when something __burns__
- Combustion reactions are EXOTHERMIC (i.e. light, sound, heat are usually produced)
- Oxygen (or any oxidizer) is always a component of a combustion reaction
- An example of a combustion reaction is burning Propane:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{2C_3 H_{8(g)} +7O_{2(g)}}\\)$\rightarrow$\\(\color{lightblue}{2C_{(s)} + 2CO_{(g)}+ 2CO_{2(g)} +8H_2 O_{(g)}}\\)
- Some combustion reactions only have \\(CO_2\\) and $H_2 O$ as products
  - These are known as "complete combustion reactions"
  - An example of a complete combustion reaction is burning Methane:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{CH_4 +2O_2}\\)$\rightarrow$\\(\color{lightblue}{CO_2 +2H_2 O}\\)
### Precipitation Reactions
- When soluble ionic compounds are dissolved in water, the lattice "dissolves", and the ions are separated
![Image of the dissolution of an ionic compound](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/psharma04/Content-Delivery-Network/b92976f4/schoolnotes.intranet.pw/dissolution-of-an-ionic-compound-in-water-n.jpg)
- If two solutions are mixed together, it's really just 4 different ions suspended in water
- However, certain combinations of ions will form an insoluble compound when mixed
- These compounds will form a PRECIPITATE, a small ionic crystal lattice
- This is known as a precipitation reaction
- An example is mixing sodium sulfide and copper sulfate solutions:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{Na_2 S_{(aq)}+CuSO_{4(aq)}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{CuS_{(s)}+Na_2SO_{4(aq)}}\\)
#### Solubility Rules
- The solubility rules are used to determine which compound is the precipitate

### Corrosion Reactions
- Corrosion is a reaction involving a metallic element being converted into a more chemically stable form (e.g. an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide)
- Combustion and Corrosion are both types of "oxidization reactions"
- Corrosion is EXOTHERMIC, although not as much as combustion
- An example of corrosion is iron rusting:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{4Fe+3O_2}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{2Fe_2 O_3}\\)
### Acids and Bases
#### Neutralization Reactions
- When an acid and base are added together, they "neutralise" each other
- This creates water and an ionic compound known as a "salt"
- The general formula for acid-base reactions is:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Acid}+\text{Base}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Salt}+H_2 O}\\)
#### Acid-Metal Reactions (Displacement Reactions)
- Many metals will react with Acids to produce a "salt" and Hydrogen gas (\\(H_2\\))
- The general formula for Acid-Metal reactions is:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Acid}+\text{Metal}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Salt}+H_2}\\)
#### Acid-Carbonate Reactions
- When an acid reacts with a carbonate compound, the products are always \\(CO_2\\), \\(H_2 O\\), and a salt
- The general formula is:
> \\(\color{lightgreen}{\text{Acid}+\text{Carbonate Compound}}\\)\\(\rightarrow\\)\\(\color{lightblue}{\text{Salt}+H_2 O + CO_2 }\\)
## Conservation of Mass
- Chemical reactions ALWAYS obey the Law of Conservation of Mass:
> Matter cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.
- Module 1 included a section on Nuclear Reactions, where atoms changed into different elements
  - This NEVER occurs in a chemical reaction!!!
