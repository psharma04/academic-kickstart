## Ionic Nomenclature
- Cation uses its original name (e.g. Sodium)
- If the anion has no extra oxygen (e.g. Cl, N, O, etc.), change suffix to -ide (e.g. Cl becomes Chloride)
- If the anion has standard number of oxygen (e.g. \\(PO_4\\) ), change  suffix to -ate (e.g. \\(PO_4\\) becomes Phosphate)
- If the anion has one less than the standard number of oxygen (e.g. \\(NO_2\\)), change  suffix to -ite (e.g. \\(NO_2\\) becomes Nitrite)
- If the anion has two less than the standard number of oxygen (e.g. \\(NO\\)), change the prefix to hypo- and the suffix to -ite (e.g. \\(NO\\) becomes Hyponitrite)
