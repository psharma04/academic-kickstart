<li>Religion is composed of beliefs and practises that provide meaning and purposes to adherents.
<ul>

<li>Transcends their world and limitations
</li>
</ul>

<li>Achieved through religion having a worldview - the way in which a society views the world. In religion, the worldview is determined by the principal beliefs of the religion

<li>Society determines the way which someone views the world - provides a set of cultural assumptions that culminate in the forming of a worldview

<li>Worldview = perception/conception of the world. Consists of meaning, purpose, belonging and identity

<li>Religions have their own worldviews
<ul>

<li>Buddhism - sees time as a cycle and the world is one part of that cycle

<li>Christianity, Judaism & Islam - see time as linear (has a beginning and an end

    <strong>Notes:</strong>
<p>

    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Transcendent Religious Worldview</span>
<ul>

<li>Beliefs in divine powers that exceed human limitations - the deity or the supernatural dimension is not on Earth, but beyond or above it

<li>Adherents turn to the divine and beyond the physical world as a way to escape the concerns of the material world

<li>Adherents, therefore, are able to focus their attention on heavenly matters, rather than the physical concerns of the natural world
<p>

    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Immanent Religious Worldview</span>
<ul>

<li>The divine powers and being are present within the natural world, or within humans themselves.
<ul>

<li>Especially made evident through adherents' daily activities and actions
</li>
</ul>

<li>The God or gods are present within, rather than above or beyond, the natural world. Adherents use each other or other aspects of the world to express their spirituality
<p>

    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">A Combination of Immanent and Transcendent Elements</span>
<ul>

<li>Religions may have both religious and transcendent elements, or the whole religion can be firmly either transcendent or immanent

<li>For example, the different aspects of the religion may be either transcendent or immanent, or the God can exist in several forms, some of which are transcendent and some are immanent

<li>EG - CHRISTIANITY: the transcendent God, who can not be seen or held by humans, sent His only Son who was the immanent Him on the Earth.

<li>EG - JUDAISM: the transcendent God was incomprehensible to adherents, however, He held close relationships with Abraham and Moses, showing elements of immanence

   <td><strong>Summary : </strong>
   </td>
   <td>Religious worldviews can be further divided into transcendent and immanent. A transcendent worldview refers to one in which the supernatural being is beyond the human world, an example of which is the Jewish God. An immanent religious worldview refers to the presence of the supernatural being in or within the world, an example is Jesus Christ, who walked the world. Religions may contain both transcendent and immanent elements.

<li>If it fails to do this, the religion loses relevance in a modern world and stagnates
</li>
</ul>

<li>Dynamic, living religions are ones that stimulate change and constantly refresh themselves, in order to remain immersed in mundane activities and society

<li>Through the interactions between the four characteristics of religion, the Faith remains relevant to adherents and society. As a result, the characteristics are interdependent when forming the dynamic religion

<li>For example, believers read sacred texts to formulate their own interpretation of the religion. The sacred texts also inform ethical teachings and rituals and ceremonies, which believers use to express their Faith

<li>As adherents develop over time, their interpretation of the sacred texts change due to outside influences and personal preference, causing the beliefs and ethics formulated from them to vary between years.

<ul>

<li>Peter became the leader of the Church.

<li>Christianity remains a sect of Judaism - adherents follow Mosaic Law and the teachings based on Hebrew Scripture, however, they celebrate the Eucharist and Baptism

<li>There was little formal activity in this period, as all believed that Christ's second coming was soon
</li>
</ul>

<li>49 CE (Council of Jerusalem) - Christians were made to abandon all pagan beliefs and follow the decalogue + Jesus' teachings
<ul>

<li>Christianity was opened to the wider world, and all people could join if they renounced pagan ways and joined Christ

<li>The mass following this attracted was a catalyst for the separation from Judaism

<li>The destruction of the Jewish Temple as a result of the failed Jewish Revolt against Romans (66-73 CE) led to mass migration from citizens living in Judea

<li>The growing numbers of followings made formalisation of the belief imminent, which led to Christianity's split from Judaism in 100 CE

<li>64-313 CE (Persecution) - The Jewish people were angered with Christianity's split and were fearful of Roman punishments if Jesus' teachings continued to spread across the Roman Empire.

<li>As a result, Christian people were persecuted by the Romans and the Jewish people. During this time, followings declined significantly

<li>'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the communion of Holy Spirit be with you all' (Corinthians 13:14) - this is used in the mass

<li>'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19) - this is used in sacramental Baptism

<li>Promise of a relationship with God

<li>Promise of numerous descendants

<li>Promise of land

    <strong>Notes:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Jewish people believe that God is the solve divine God, who was, is and always will be. This poses Judaism as a monotheistic religion.
<ul>

<li>“You shall have no other God before me, you shall not make for yourself an idol”
</li>
</ul>

<li>God is believed to be transcendent, immanent and the Creator. He is separate from the world, however, is still present through the Covenant with Abraham

<li>Adherents avoid material representation of God, believing he is incorporeal - as a result, they avoid iconography and physical representations of Him

<li>Jewish people believe that God is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Although God is separate from the physical world, He has a deep relationship with humanity through His love for them. Demonstrated in Genesis 1:26 "Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=NIV#fen-NIV-26a">a</a>] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

<li>God is good and everything that He creates is good. He does not act out of anger or personal preference, but rather morality itself.

<li>God is holy, “You shall be holy because I the Lord your God am holy” (Lev 19:2). Holiness ennobles ethics, which enables life

<li>Hebrew scripture describes God in three ways
<ul>

<li>As a clan - e.g. God of Abraham and his descendants

<li>God of the land of Israel - Covenant with God and Jews is lined by the land

<li>Universal God - creator of the universe
</li>
</ul>

<li>Jewish people aim to emulate the attributes of God through their lives. They do this in many ways, inclusive of the Shema; a declaration of faith proclaimed twice a day by Jewish adherents. It consists of three Torah passages. The first one demonstrates Jewish monotheism, reading "Hear, O Israel: The Hashem our God, the Hashem is one" Deuteronomy 6:4

<li>248 are positive commandments - rituals of Jewish people, obedience to covenant

<li>365 are negative commandments - actions one must refrain from doing

<li>The Mitzvot contain all aspects of life and worship and are used by the Jewish people to express their faithfulness to the Covenant.

<li>Orthodox Jews believe that the laws were revealed to humans by God and are therefore Divine. Non-Orthodox Jews believe that the laws are divinely inspired

<li>Some Mitzvot no longer apply to modern life. Some Mitzvot apply not only to Jews, but to all people of the world.

<li>The covenant serves as an immanent aspect of the Jewish faith and limits God's omnipotence by giving the Jewish people freewill. However, this comes with many moral obligations
