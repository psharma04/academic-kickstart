## Roots of multiplicity r
- A root of a polynomial is a value of \\(x\\) for which \\(P(x)=0\\)
  - For example, \\(P(x)=x^2+6x+9\\) can be expressed as \\((x+3)^2\\)
  - In this case, \\(-3\\) is a root of multiplicity 2 of \\(P(x)\\)
- Roots of multiplicity 1 are also known as "single roots"
- Roots of multiplicity 2 are also known as "double roots"
- Roots of multiplicity 2 are also known as "triple roots"

## Curve Sketching
- Graphs with multiple roots have specific rules for sketching
#### Rules for Leading Coefficient and Degrees
- The table below explains what happens as a graph approaches infinity and negative infinity, based on the leading coefficient and degree:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Degree: Odd</td><td>Degree: Even</td></tr><tr><td>Leading Coefficient: Positive</td><td>Up Arrow: 1st Quadrant<br>Down Arrow: 3rd Quadrant</td><td>Up Arrows: 1st and 2nd Quadrant</td></tr><tr><td>Leading Coefficient: Negative</td><td>Up Arrow: 2nd Quadrant<br>Down Arrow: 4th Quadrant</td><td>Down Arrows: 3rd and 4th Quadrant</td></tr></table>

- When a graph approaches the x-axis to mark a single root, the x axis is said to be "cut" by the graph (red line)
- When a graph approaches the x-axis to mark an odd multiple root, the graph is said to "slide" at the x-axis (green line)
- When a graph approaches the x-axis to mark an even multiple root, the graph is said to "bounce" at the x-axis (blue line)
