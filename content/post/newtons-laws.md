## First Law: Inertia

<blockquote>An object in motion will stay in motion, and will maintain its speed and direction, unless acted on by an unbalanced force</blockquote>

- The principle of INERTIA is that all objects have a tendency to resist change in motion.
- An object with all forces balanced out will not change speed or direction until another force is applied to it.
  - For example, a person sitting on a chair is being pulled down by gravity, but pushed up with an equal NORMAL FORCE. The person does not change speed or direction.
  - If the person in the above example is in a moving car, which suddenly brakes, the person will continue to move forward until they are stopped by the seat in front of them: the person resists any change in motion until acted on by an external force (the seat in front)
- A more massive object therefore needs more force to reach the same acceleration as a less massive object.

## Second Law

<blockquote>Force is equal to mass times acceleration</blockquote>

- This is expressed mathematically as \\(F=ma\\)
  - F: Force in Newtons (N)
  - m: Mass in Kilograms (kg)
  - a: Acceleration in Meters per Second squared \\(m/s^2\\)

## Third Law

<blockquote>Every Action has an Equal but Opposite Reaction</blockquote>

- The reaction force is known as the NORMAL FORCE
- The Normal force always acts perpendicular (at \\(90^\circ\\)) to the surface that your object is on
- The Normal force changes magnitude based on the force that it is attempting to balance
