## How to Write Posts
Not following these rules will result in your post not being posted!!!
### Essentials:
- Learn basic Markdown formatting.
  - Markdown is a lightweight and easily readable format for websites.
  - [Guide to formatting in Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  - If you are writing up mathematics pages, format math stuff using MathJax ([Guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference))
### Formatting Rules:
- Header Block:
  - Title should be structured as: `Subject - Topic - Year Level (optional)`
  - For example: `SOR1 - Core Ethical Teachings of Judaism - Year 11`
  - If you are a writer for the site, you will be provided with a writer ID. In the header of each post, add the line `discussionId: writer_id-post_number`
  - For example: `W1234-P10` where `W1234` is the writer ID and `P10` is the 10th post by that writer.
  - Anonymous posts should use writer ID `WA1` with no post number. A post number will be assigned randomly after moderation. Identified writers will only be moderated for the first post, and randomly after that.
- Post Contents:
  - DO NOT REPEAT THE TOPIC!!!
  - Syllabus points and learning intentions should be placed at the end of the post (Optional but recommended)
  - Subheadings start from h2 (##). Every sub-sub heading should have another # added to it.
    - For example, on this page, `How to write posts` is h2 (##). `Formatting Rules` is h3 (###). More #'s means another sub-topic.
    - If a component has 3 or more subheadings, it should probably be a separate post.
  - Break down the information into dot points (i.e. lines should start with a dash `-` or an asterisk `*`).
  - No more than 2 sentences per dot point.
  - You CAN stack points by indenting them (add a space before the dash/asterisk).
    - If a point has more than 3 indents, it should probably have its own heading.
    - Stacked points can be used to elaborate or define key points/terms (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
  - Images/diagrams can be used, and are recommended for subjects such as sciences, math and TAS subjects (Art, music, technology, STEM, etc.)
  - Include a table of definitions and Subject-Specific Terminology (If needed) at the end of the post. Also include your name and best contact email. (See sample Markdown document)
    - Tables should be in HTML due to a bug in the render engine. [Guide for HTML Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)
