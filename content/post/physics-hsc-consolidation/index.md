Light is the smallest amount of energy that can be transported. It has a wave particle duality being a photon as well as an electromagnetic wave. Visible light is between 400-700nm.

Light is created when an electron in its excited state drops back to a lower energy state and loses excess energy in the form of EM radiation.

The moving charge of an electron creates an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to an oscillating electric field.

   <td>Newton proposed that light was made up of tiny perfectly elastic <strong>particles</strong>.
<p>
Newton concluded that travel in straight lines in all possible directions thus, they were particles not waves as waves propagate
<p>
Rate at which they travel depend on the medium they are in.
<p>
Believed <strong>light must be a particle as it travelled in a vacuum</strong> and waves were believed to require a medium
<p>
<strong>Reflection</strong> of light is just like the rebound of a perfectly elastic ball (explains equality of angle of incidence and angle of reflection).
<p>
<strong>Refraction</strong> was due to change in speed of particles caused by net attraction of particles to a medium with more matter however, he thought light travelled faster in denser mediums eg: water.
<p>
When a ray is in a medium the ray moves in a straight line as Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law states that the ray will not bend if no net external force (none since attracted equally on all sides)
<p>
Light splits due to the size of the particle (Theory of Fits), particles that fit between atoms of the medium would refract and light that could not would reflect
<p>
He also said that different colours of light had different size particles thus, causing separation of white light to occur.
<p>
Light particles have an ambiguous, non-spherical shape which allows for polarisation
<p>
Newton could not explain absorption.

   <td>Huygen proposed that light <strong>was a wave</strong> that <strong>propagated perpendicular</strong> to its direction of travel and has a miniscule wavelength.
<p>
Huygen knew that waves must have a propagating medium so Huygen called the <strong>medium for light the ‘luminiferous aether’</strong>, which supposedly fills up all space thus, allowing light waves to travel
<p>
<strong>Huygen's principle:</strong> Every point on a wavefront is a source for secondary semicircular ‘wavelets’ which spread out in the forward direction with the same speed as the wave. The new wavefront is the tangent to all the secondary waves. When part of the wavelets is blocked, the tangent is modified.
<p>
<strong>Reflection:</strong> When the wave meets the surface at an angle, new wavelets are created which form a new wavefront that propagates at an angle equal to the angle of incidence

**Wavefront:** continuous line or surface containing points affected in the same way by wave at a given time.

**Interference:** two waves superimposed to form a resultant wave of greater, lower or same amplitude.

Diffraction

Process by which a beam of light is spread out as a result of passing through a narrow aperture or across an edge. It is observed when waves spend around the barrier or through an aperture. The most pronounced diffraction occurs when the size of the aperture is **close** to the wavelength of the incident waves. Diffraction is a feature of all waves.

Diffraction gratings have parallel slits (gaps) which light passes through. As light passes through the gap it bends at the edges leading to destructive or constructive interference.

**Single Slit Diffraction**

When monochromatic light (light of a single wavelength/frequency) is passed through a narrow slit, Huygen’s wavelets allow the wave to interfere with others as well as turn corners thus, causing an interference pattern on the screen.

If one wavefront passes through the left of the slit and another from the right, when they meet, they will have travelled slightly different distances. This difference is the path difference. If wavefronts are aligned when they meet, they will constructively interfere, if they are out of phase by 180<sup>o</sup> they will destructively interfere. This interference causes the interference pattern.

Most light energy is concentrated on central maxima (wave travels equal distance from both sides of the slit).

A diffraction grating is when light passes through a number of slits. They're used when light of different wavelengths needs to be separated at a high resolution. Light waves emerging from the gaps will interfere with light waves from adjacent gaps to create an interference pattern. They are used in spectrographs.

Condition for **destructive **interference for single slit:

dsinθ = mλ where d is slit width (m) for single slit diffraction, θ is angle of diffraction, m is order of interference, λ is wavelength (m)

Single slit wavelength:

λ = ½yd/mL where y is node to node (1/2y is central bright to midline of dark), d is slit width (m), m is order of interference, L is distance from slit to screen (m)


## 1801 Young's Double Slit Experiment

In 1801, Thomas Young designed his double slit experiment on the basis that:



*   If light was a wave then when two rays of light meet there must be interference
*   The interference would either be constructive or destructive
*   He understood beat frequencies produced from soundwave interference and he wanted to test whether light would exhibit similar behaviour

For interference to be detected, Young concluded that the two sources must:



*   Be coherent (frequency and waveform are identical)
*   Maintain constant phase relationship
*   Have the same frequency waves
*   Have approximately the same amplitude

**Method:**



1. Sunlight was first shone through a single slit with a red filter to create a coherent light source (monochromatic and coherent)
2. The light was then projected onto a detection screen through two miniscule slits which produced an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen
3. Slits of different sizes and distances apart were then tested
4. Young was able to calculate the wavelength associated with light as well as provide convincing evidence for Huygen's wave model

    Using: y = mλL/d for small angles L >> d where y is antinode separation on screen (middle of one bright spot to next bright spot), λ is wavelength, L is distance from slit to screen, d is slit width, m is order of interference (central maxima is 1, one to the right is 2, left is -2…).


    Or using:


    y = (m+1/2)λL/d for small angles L >> d where y is node separation on screen (dark to dark), m is order of interference, λ is wavelength (m), L is distance between screen and slit (m) and d is slit separation (m)


**Findings: **This resulted in the formation of an interference fringe consisting of clear light and dark sections on an observation screen. The only way this could happen was if light was a wave because otherwise adding more light particles to an area should not produce a section of no light.

The negative and positive sections of the interference pattern were due to constructive (bright light, in phase) and destructive (no light, 180 degrees out of phase) interference occurring.

He was able to calculate the wavelength of light by using distances between 2 areas of constructive interference and 2 areas of destructive interference as y.

**Path difference:** Difference in distance travelled by two waves to a point on the screen

Constructive interference occurs when the path difference is 0 or whole number of wavelengths.

Condition for **constructive** interference for double slit:

dsinθ = mλ where d is slit separation (m) for double slit diffraction, θ is angle at which constructive interference occurs, m is order of interference, λ is wavelength (m)

dsinθ = (m+ 1/2)λ where d is slit separation (m) for double slit diffraction, θ is angle at which destructive interference occurs, m is order of interference, λ is wavelength (m)

θ is angles at which constructive/destructive interference occurs (depends what formula)

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image16.gif "image_tooltip")


**Double slit wavelength:**

λ = yd/mL where y is central maxima to nearest antinode, d is slit width (m), m is order of interference, L is distance from slit to screen (m)

Diffraction gratings contain a large number of parallel, closely spaced slits or grooves.  They produce interference maxima at angles θ given by dsinθ = mλ where distance between slits is d, angle to a bright fringe of a particular colour is θ, m is order of interference, λ is wavelength

Path difference: mλ

**Relationships:**



*   The central intensity is proportional to the square of the number of sources. (direct square)
*   The smaller the wavelength RELATIVE to the slit, the less diffraction (direct)
*   The greater the wavelength RELATIVE to the slit, the greater the diffraction (direct)
*   Fringe separation is DIRECTLY proportional to wavelength/frequency of radiation forming it (direct)
*   Width of the diffraction pattern is INVERSELY proportional to slit width (inverse)
*   With double slit interference we still have a diffraction envelope, inside that there are the interference fringes.
*   Spreading out of the diffraction envelope is determined by width of the slit whereas fringe separation is determined by space between two slits.
*   Decreasing slit separation increases fringe separation (inverse)
*   Increasing width of the slit, central maximum narrows (inverse)
*   Increasing L (distance from screen to slit), increases fringe separation (direct)
*   Decreasing d, increases fringe separation (inverse)


## Polarisation

Polarisation occurs when a transverse wave is allowed to move only in one direction.

Light produced by a light globe or the sun comes out as waves in all planes. A light wave that is vibrating in more than one plane is referred to as unpolarised light. Such light waves are created by electric charges that vibrate in a variety of directions, thus creating an electromagnetic wave that vibrates in a variety of directions.

Polarised light waves are light waves in which the vibrations occur in a single plane. The process of transforming unpolarised light into polarised light is known as polarisation.

**THIS FORMULA FOR THE SECOND POLARISER OF A TWO POLARISER QUESTION, to find intensity change of a single polariser it is simply ½ original intensity**

Malus’ Law:

I = I<sub>0</sub> cos<sup>2</sup>θ where I<sub>0</sub> is the intensity of the polarised wave before passing through the filter (Wm), I is intensity of transmitted wave (Wm) and θ is angle between the two polarisation axes (<sup>o</sup>) (negative to the left, positive to the right).

The first polarizing filter is called the polarizer, the second polarizing filter is called the analyser.

Factors that influence intensity of transmitted wave (I):



*   Analyser angle
    *   Sinusoidal relationship when intensity of I is plotted against (y axis) analyser angle relative to polariser angle (x axis)
        *   When analyser is at angle of 0<sup>o</sup> relative to the polariser’s polarising axis, intensity is at a MAXIMUM of 0.5I<sub>0</sub>
        *   Intensity approaches zero as angle increases (inverse)
        *   The same angle either positive or negative, have the same impact on intensity of transmitted wave (I<sub>0</sub>)

I/I<sub>0</sub> vs cos<sup>2</sup>θ gives a positive linear graph.

**Summary of Investigation:**

IV: Angle between polariser and analyser angle (θ)

DV: intensity of transmitted light (I)

CV: angle of polariser, intensity of source (I<sub>0</sub>), distance between photodetector and analyser, distance between polariser and analyser

Aim: Reaffirm Malus’s Law

Method:



1. Clamp one polarising filter to the retort stand by attaching the arm of the clamp with the boss head.
2. Adjust the polarising filter so that the polarising axis is completely vertical using a protractor and aligning with the 90<sup>o</sup> line.
3. Clamp the second polarising filter to the second retort stand around 15cm away from the first retort stand. Adjust the filter so that the polarising axis is perpendicular to the polarising axis of the first polaroid filter, aligned with 0<sup>o</sup> on the protractor.
4. Connect the lamp to a power source and place 5cm in front of the first polarising filter.
5. Connect the photo detector and place 5cm behind the second polaroid filter (analyser)
6. Adjust so that the heights of the lamp, polariser, analyser and photodetector are in line with each other.
7. Turn on the lamp and record intensity reading on the photodetector.
8. Carefully adjust the angle of the analyser to 10<sup>o</sup>, measured using the protractor and record reading on the photodetector.
9. Repeat from angles 10-90<sup>o</sup> in the clockwise direction and 10-90<sup>o</sup> in anti-clockwise direction.
10. Record results, indicating different direction with – for anti-clockwise and + for clockwise.

Equipment:



*   Protractor
*   2 polarising films
*   Unpolarised source of light (lamp)
*   Photo detector
*   2 clamps
*   2 retort stands
*   2 boss heads


## Forms of polarisation:

**Polarisation by polaroid filter**

A polarising filter only transmits components of the wave in a particular direction and absorbs the rest. A practical application is polarising sunglasses, which absorb light in a particular plane, reducing glare. The chemical composition of the polaroid filter allows one plane of waves to pass through and the other plane of waves parallel to the molecular alignment of the filter to be absorbed by the filter. When unpolarised light is transmitted through a polaroid filter, it emerges with **one-half** the intensity and with vibrations in a single plane.

The polarisation axis is perpendicular to molecule alignment and extends across the length of the filter. It only allows vibrations of the electromagnetic wave that are parallel to the axis to pass through. Any vibrations that are perpendicular to the polarisation axis are blocked by the filter. The filter does not distort the shape or dimensions of the object; it produces a dimmer image of the object since one-half of the light is blocked.

The angle between the direction of polarisation and the axis of a filter is θ.

If the electric field has an amplitude E, then the transmitted part of the wave has an amplitude Ecosθ. Since the intensity of a wave is proportional to its amplitude squared, the intensity of the transmitted wave is related to the incident wave by Malus’s Law:

I α E<sup>2</sup>

E = E<sub>0</sub>cosθ

E<sup>2</sup> = E<sub>0<sup>2</sup></sub>cos<sup>2</sup>θ

I = I<sub>0</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>θ

**Polarisation by reflection**

Unpolarised light can also undergo polarisation by reflection off of non-metallic surfaces. Extent of polarisation is dependent upon angle of light’s approach and material of surface. The reflected ray is fully polarised horizontally (vibrating in a plane that is parallel to the surface of the material) at Brewster’s angle (angle of which reflected light is fully polarised, refracted and reflected beam are perpendicular, unique to each medium) as when the incident light crosses the interface, the light is absorbed temporarily by atoms in the second medium. Electrons in these atoms oscillate back and forth in the direction of the electric field vectors in the refracted ray, perpendicular to the direction the refracted light is traveling. The light is re-emitted by the atoms to form both the reflected and refracted rays. The electric field vectors in the light match the direction the electrons were oscillating, and they must be perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. When light comes in at the Brewster angle the reflected wave has no electric field vectors parallel to the refracted ray, because the electrons do not oscillate along that direction. The reflected wave also has no electric field vectors parallel to the reflected ray, because that's the direction of propagation of the wave. The only direction possible is perpendicular to the plane of the picture, so the reflected ray is linearly polarised

Formula for Brewster’s Angle:

n = sin(θ<sub>i</sub>)/sin(θ<sub>r</sub>) = sin(θ<sub>i</sub>)/sin(θ<sub>90-i</sub>) = tan(θ<sub>i</sub>) where n is the refractive index of the medium from which the light is reflected, θ<sub>i</sub> is the angle of incidence, and θ<sub>r</sub> is the angle of refraction.

If the angle between the reflected ray and refracted ray is 90° then the reflected light is completely polarised in one plane.

**Polarisation by refraction**

Polarisation can also occur by the refraction of light. Refraction occurs when a beam of light passes from one material into another material. At the surface of the two materials, the path of the beam changes its direction. The light transmitted into the medium is partially polarised as it has lost the reflected light that is polarised by the reflecting surface.

if an object is viewed by looking through an Iceland Spar crystal, two images will be seen. The two images are the result of the double refraction of light. Both refracted light beams are polarised - one in a direction parallel to the surface and the other in a direction perpendicular to the surface. Since these two refracted rays are polarised with a perpendicular orientation, a polarizing filter can be used to completely block one of the images.

**Polarisation through scattering**

Polarisation also occurs when light is scattered while traveling through a medium. Since light waves are electromagnetic (EM) waves (transverse waves) they will vibrate the electrons of air molecules perpendicular to the direction in which they are traveling. Vibrating electrons then produce EM radiation that is polarised perpendicular to the direction of the ray. The light parallel to the original ray has no polarisation. The light perpendicular to the original ray is completely polarised. In all other directions, the light scattered by air will be partially polarised. Polarisation by scattering is observed as light passes through our atmosphere. The scattered light often produces a glare in the skies. See gif.

The fact that light can be polarised is an important piece of evidence for the wave nature of light, in particular that light is a transverse wave as light can be polarised and only transverse waves can be polarised.


## _IQ: What is light?_


## EMR

The wavefront of electromagnetic waves emitted from a point source (such as a light bulb) is a sphere. EM waves carry energy (E), momentum (p) and angular momentum (L) away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact

The electromagnetic spectrum is split into ionising and non-ionising radiation. Ionising includes: gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet and means that these waves have enough energy to break chemical bonds and strip atoms of electrons. Non-ionising includes: visible light, infrared, microwaves and radio waves and means that these waves cannot break chemical bonds or ionise atoms hence, they are not dangerous. Waves are listed in order of smallest wavelength to largest wavelengths.

All objects whose temperature is above 0K emit EMR. The exact type depends on the energy of the object and **not **on the characteristics of the material.

When an object starts to heat up, it may radiate heat (infrared) but may not emit visible light. As the object is heated further, the object will begin to glow red, releasing red as visible light. Afterwards, orange, yellow, white and then blue as the temperature increases. The higher the temperature, the higher the frequency. Therefore, the EMR emitted is due to the object's temperature. LED (light emitting diode) and fluorescent light operate with a different method.

In quantum mechanics, EMR consists of photons which are miniscule elastic particles that exhibit wave-particle duality and have energy quantised as per E = hf.


## Maxwell’s Contribution

Maxwell worked with 4 laws to produce a unified theory of classical electromagnetism. These are:

Gauss's Law of Electrical Flux $\rightarrow$ point charges radiate an electric field outwards as if there is a net charge inside a Gaussian surface (surface that smoothly encloses charge), there must be charge leaving it

Gauss’s Law of Magnetic Flux $\rightarrow$ Magnetic field lines are always looped thus, there are no magnetic monopoles

Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction $\rightarrow$ a changing magnetic field generates a changing electric field

Ampere's Circuital Law $\rightarrow$ a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the electric field (using the displacement current). Involves μ<sub>0</sub> and ε<sub>0</sub> which can be measured in laboratory.

**Prediction of EM waves:**

Maxwell predicted that EM waves are made up of two mutually (simultaneously) propagating electric and magnetic fields at right-angles to each other which are self-propagating and extend into space (vacuum). He also predicted that EMR was light and also that EMR had a large range of frequencies beyond the visible spectrum.

**Explanation:** A propagating electric field generates a propagating magnetic field as changing electric flux induces a magnetic field. This generated magnetic field in turn generates an area of changing magnetic flux (see diagram) as the closed loop formed by the respective points of the transverse wave form an area where a changing magnetic flux occurs thus, inducing a changing electric field. This cycle allows EM waves to travel in a vacuum without an external propagating force.

**Production of EMR:** Every accelerated charge (velocity needs to change either by change in direction or speed) radiates EMR. A moving electron produces a magnetic field, but this magnetic field is constant because the electron’s motion has a constant velocity. In order for an electron to radiate Electromagnetic (EM) radiation, it needs to accelerate as changing magnetic fields produce changing electric fields, causing self-propagation. A charged particle oscillating about an equilibrium position is an accelerating charged particle.  If its frequency of oscillation is f, then it produces an electromagnetic wave with frequency f.  The wavelength λ of this wave is given by λ = c/f.

You set up a broadcasting antenna with an AC power source which produces EMR which can be received by a receiving antenna at some distance away tuned to receive the frequency of EMR emitted. (how radios work)

**Maxwell found that EM waves travelled at the speed of light. **He theorised that the electrical and magnetic constants should be related as electricity and magnetism are related. Dividing the electric constant by the magnetic constant, he found that the units were m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup> which was a square of the units of velocity. Square rooting his answer (1/√μ<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>0</sub>), he found that it was very close to the speed of light. This provided evidence that light was EMR.

**Heinrich Hertz’s Evidence for Maxwell:**

Hertz measured the wavelength and frequency of light by doubling the measurement of consecutive bright spark points of his generated standing wave. Hertz was also the first person to observe the photoelectric effect.

He surmised that the spark produced in the broadcasting antenna would induce a small spark in the receiving antennae as the EMR reaches it. This was what had occurred thus, he concluded that there was an EM wave between the two antennae.

He found that EM waves are able to be reflected by placing a reflective sheet between the two antennae.

And refracted as when he placed pitchblende between the two receivers, he had to move the receiver to observe the spark.

He lined up the reflective sheet with the receivers so that a standing wave was now produced:

And he moved the receiver to observe when large sparks occurred. He noticed that large sparks occurred at the antinodes.

By measuring distance between successive bright sparks which was equivalent to λ/2, he could double it and find the full wavelength. The frequency was known thus, he could find velocity of the wave using v = fλ which v = c, validating Maxwell’s predictions.

**How did he discover the photoelectric effect?**

He placed his ‘receiver’ coil in a dark box which caused the spark induced in the receiver to diminish considerably. Baffled, he placed a pane of glass in front of the receiver, which caused the spark's intensity to diminish more but, with a quartz screen the spark remained close to its intensity in air. This was because the glass screen blocked some of the unseen UV rays of EM radiation that contributed to the spark (E = hf).


## Measuring Velocity of Light


## _Historical_

**_Galileo_**

When? 1638

Principle? If a time lag could be found it shows that the speed of light is indeed finite. If the distance between the two people was recorded and the time lag found then one could calculate the speed of light using v = s/t.

Method?



1. Two people stood a known distance from each other, holding a covered lamp
2. One person would uncover their lamp
3. Once the other person saw the light of the uncovered lamp, they would also uncover their lamp.
4. The time lag between the first person uncovering their lamp and the second person uncovering their lamp would be t used in v =s/t and was measured using Galileo’s pulse
5. Steps 1-4 were repeated with progressively greater distances until the two people needed telescopes to see each other
6. Repeated each distance to minimise impact of reaction time on result (random error)

Value? Inconclusive, no value was found as there was no perceptible time lag. Galileo only concluded that the speed of light was ‘If not instantaneous, it is extraordinarily rapid’ and deduced that it was 10x faster than the speed of sound.

Pros vs cons? Method was not valid in determining the speed of light as the speed of light was too rapid to have a perceptible time lag.

Lack of reliable scientific equipment such as the lack of a precise timing device to approximate time lag.

Variables such as the person’s eyesight were not controlled. This would have large impacts when distances increased and telescopes had to be used.

**_Roemer_**

When? 1676

Principle? Due to the difference between the time when eclipses would occur which are dependent on the position of Earth. He concluded that the speed of light was finite, as he deduced that the eclipse was delayed because light had to travel a longer distance hence, speed of light was not instantaneous.

Method? Romer studied the movement of Io (Jupiter’s moon) around Jupiter by recording the times of eclipses over the course of many years. However, contrary to his expectation that the interval between subsequent eclipses would remain constant, he found that the time interval varied in length depending on the distance between Jupiter and Earth. When Earth was closest to Jupiter (opposition) the eclipse would be 11 minutes earlier than predicted whereas when the Earth was farthest from Jupiter (conjunction) it would eclipse 11 minutes later than predicted time. Romer concluded that this was due to the finite speed of light.

The speed of light could then be found by measuring the time delay between position of conjunction and opposition and then diving Earth’s diameter by it (v = s/t). Roemer estimated that light required 22min to cross the diameter of Earth.

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image23.png "image_tooltip")


Value? 200,000 km/s or 210,824 km/s (approx. 30% error)

Pros vs cons?

Provided the first quantitative measurement of the speed of light and disproved the theory that it was instantaneous regardless of distance.

However, due to lack of knowledge of the Earth’s diameter of orbit and inaccuracy of time delay measurement due to equipment constraints, the value is merely an approximation and has a percentage error of around 30%.

**_Fizeau_**

When? 1849

Principle? Speed of light is equal to twice the distance between the source and the mirror used to reflect the light back (that is the distance light travels in total) divided by the time it takes to complete that distance (v= s/t).

Method?



1. Light source was shone through a semi-reflective mirror, this was done to guide the reflected beam of light back to his eye thus, reducing impact of human reaction time
2. Using a spinning cog with 720 slits, the cog was spun at a specific frequency so that the beam of light would travel through one slit upon approaching a second mirror set 8630m from the first mirror and the reflected beam would travel back through the adjacent slit upon returning.
3. Using the number of cog slits and the frequency of the cog’s spinning, Fizeau could calculate time taken for one slit to shift so that the adjacent slit would take its place. (if frequency was 5 Hz, he would find time for 1 cog to switch to the next by first calculating time for 1 revolution using T = 1/f = 1/5 s and then dividing 1/5 by 720, 1/3600 s) Knowing the angular velocity in revolutions per second (rps) and number of teeth, he could find time taken for one gap to pass using c = 2dnv where d is distance to mirror, n is number of teeth, v is wheel’s rps or 2d/[(1/v)/n]
4. The speed of light was then found by dividing the total distance travelled by the light, which was double the distance from the light source to the mirror by this time.

Value? 313,300 km/s (4% error)

Pros vs cons?

Accuracy was limited by Fizeau’s use of technology which accounted for a 4% error as well as the diminished source of light over large distances. However, this method was much more accessible as the experiment could be conducted in a laboratory environment (terrestrial) allowing for repeat trials which helped increase accuracy of the speed.

**_Foucault_**

When? 1862

Principle? The time of flight of the beam of light implies a slight rotation of the spinning mirror in the time the light took to travel to the stationary mirror and back. This rotation will deflect the returning beam at an angle that deviates from the original path’s angle. Knowing the frequency of the mirror’s rotation, the equivalent time of that angle could be calculated and thus, the speed of light as the travelling distance is known.

Method? Foucault modified Fizeau’s experiment by replacing the rotating cog with a spinning mirror with a vertical axis of rotation.

The aim is to send the beam of light bouncing from the rotating mirror, to the stationary mirror and back to the rotating mirror. The total travelled distance would be double the distance between rotating and stationary mirror.

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image24.jpg "image_tooltip")


As v = s/t,

t = s/v, v in this case is the speed of light (c) and s is double the distance between the two mirrors 2d)

t = 2d/c

let the rotating mirror have an angular velocity of ω radians per second

thus, the angle it moves though in the time for light to travel and be reflected back is:

θ = ωt

sub in t = 2d/c

θ = 2ωd/c

rearranging,

c = 2ωd/θ = ∆θ/∆t x 2d/θ

Value? 299,796 km/s

Pros vs cons? Foucault improved upon Fizeau terrestrial method through replacing the cog and half-silvered mirror with one rotating mirror, this increased the precision and accuracy of his results as the angle was measured rather than distances between cogs and reaction time diminished as an influencing factor. The resulting value had only 0.6% error and this does not account for the fact that Foucault measured the speed of light in air rather than a vacuum so his margin of error may actually be smaller.

**_Michelson _**

When? 1879

Principle? If we know the distance something travels and time taken to travel the distance, we can find its speed.

Method? Michelson first chose two distant points, 35km apart. He then installed the following:

On one of the mountains he installed a regular octagonal rotating disk of which the frequency of rotations can be measured and is constant. On each of the outward facing flat faces of the octagon he installed flat mirrors.

On the other mountain he installed a large concave mirror facing back to the mountain with the rotating disk. At opposite the centre of this concave mirror was a flat mirror facing the concave mirror which allowed the beam of light to travel back to one of the flat faces of the octagonal rotating disk.



<p id="gdcalert38" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image25.png).

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image25.png "image_tooltip")


A light source was shone onto one of the octagon’s faces so that it would travel to the concave mirror and back to another octagonal face as seen above, this occurred when the disk was stationary. Michelson then slowly increased the RPS of the rotating disk until the light was observed without interruption (528rps) which is when the disk turns ⅛ in the time it takes for the light to travel to the opposing mirror and back. If the disk was spun any slower or faster no light would be able to be seen by the observer.

Example calculations:

Light travelled a distance of 2 x 35 km = 70 km = 7000m

The disk completes one full revolution in 1/528 second

The light travels 70km when the disk makes ⅛ of a turn (found by testing at what rotation will the light directly return to the observer.

Total time taken = ⅛ x 1/528 = 1/4224 s

v = d/t, therefore speed of light = 70000 x 4224 m/s = 295680000 m/s

CALCULATIONS ARE EXAMPLES ONL, RESULTS ARE NOT WHAT MICHELSON GOT

Value? 299,774 km/s

Pros vs cons? His value was very close to the accepted value of today with only 0.001% error from the accepted value. The terrestrial nature of his experiment allowed for multiple trials to be conducted. The simple nature of the calculations ensured that calculations had a low chance of error.


## _Contemporary_

**_Michelson-Morley aka Laser Interferometry_**

When? 1887 first designed, used in 1972 by NBS

Principle? V = frequency x wavelength, was also used to determine presence of luminiferous aether (null result)

Method?



1. A beam of light was shone from a laser with a known frequency
2. This beam of light was passed through a half-silvered mirror which splits the beam.
3. Two flat mirrors are placed where the split beams will land.
4. These mirrors reflect the split beams back to the half-silvered mirror where they now both travel the same path to the detector.
5. As they are waves travelling the same path, interference will occur.
6. Interference can either be constructive which would result in double intensity or destructive which would result in zero intensity.
7. To find the wavelength of the laser beam, the distance that one of the mirrors had to be moved in order to achieve perfectly constructive interference was measured and the distance one of the mirrors had to be moved in order to achieve perfectly destructive interference was measured.
8. The difference between these two points is equivalent to ¼ of a wavelength thus, the wavelength could be found by 4 x distance between the two points.

Value? 299792.458 km/s (3.5 x 10<sup>-9</sup> relative uncertainty)

**Cavity Resonance**

Involves independently measuring the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c = fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. An example would be using a microwave, if the turntable is removed, it will cook the fastest at the antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency, the value of c can be calculated

**Speed of Light through Water**

Foucault – Speed of Light Through Water

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image27.jpg "image_tooltip")


**Method: **He shined a light source on the rotating mirror. The beam went up through a tube and met the fixed mirror above the tube. The fixed mirror reflected the beam back down onto the rotating mirror again (which by now had turned a little further), the light came back a little below the source it originated from (where it says ‘air’ in the figure).

Foucault then repeated his experiment, but filled the tube now with water. If the speed of light is faster in water than it was in the air-filled tube, the light would return faster to the rotating mirror than before (which would have rotated less) and the reflected beam would come out above the spot where the beam through air came out.

However, the experiment showed the reflected beam through water came out below the spot where the beam through air came out. This formed irrefutable evidence that light travelled slower in water than in air hence, disproving Newton’s Corpuscular theory.

**Speed of Light’s Relation to Distance and Time**

The speed of light is no longer newly measured. It is used to define the length of a metre, which is defined as distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458<sup>th</sup> of a second. c is also the upper limit of velocity for all conventional mass and information, we can approach c but never reach it. C also interrelates space and time in E = mc<sup>2</sup>. The time difference between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index (n).


## Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy Is a study of how EMR interacts with matter. The spectra produced by certain elements is analysed by measuring wavelength/frequency of the waves which are seen as colour. It is used in astronomy.

**Absorption Spectra**

Absorption spectrum is produced through placing a light source behind a cool gas (the sample). The cool gas causes certain wavelengths, distinctive to the elements contained in the gas, to be absorbed forming black lines on a continuous spectrum.

**Emission Spectra**

When elements are excited through heating or electricity, the electrons of the atoms absorb energy and move to high energy levels. When they return to a grounded state, this energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation which is detected as coloured lines on a black spectrum. The colours produced by the element are distinctive and aid the determination of chemical composition.

The processes to produce either spectrums differ in that the absorption spectrum passes the gaseous elements through a cold gas cloud that is positioned in front of a light source producing a continuous spectrum whereas to produce an emission spectrum the light itself is produced by the element through exciting its atoms.

Spectroscope? A spectroscope combines a diffraction grating with a viewing telescope, allowing a spectrum to be observed. A spectrometer is the same as a spectroscope but, with an added wavelength scale. The full range of electromagnetic radiation is used when studying the universe.

Electromagnetic radiation is emitted by all objects above absolute 0 which is 0K.

## Uses of Spectroscopy

**Surface Temperature**

Using the measured maximum wavelength of radiation emitted by the star with Wien’s Law (λ<sub>max</sub> = b/T), we can find the surface temperature of the star. Or simply by looking at the colour of the star we can approximate its temperature, white $\rightarrow$ blue $\rightarrow$ yellow $\rightarrow$ orange $\rightarrow$ red

**Rotational and Translational Velocity**

The relative velocity of a star can be measured by blueshift:  star approaching observer or redshift: star moving away from observer. This is due to the Doppler effect which affects all waves. The Doppler effect occurs when there is relative movement between the wave and observer which causes an apparent change in frequency and wavelength. If the wave approaches the observer, the apparent frequency increases and wavelength decreases thus, causing blue shift. If the wave is receding from the observer, the apparent wavelength increases and the frequency decreases causing red shift. The red shift is shown by the shifting of emission spectra lines towards the left side whereas blue shift shifts lines to the right side. The amount of redshift reveals the speed of a star's movement. By finding the amount of blue and red shift on either side of a star we can find rotational velocity.

**Density**

Large supergiant stars have the lowest densities (top of HP diagram), main sequence stars have higher densities. (middle of HP diagram). Astrophysicists can calculate the:



*   Surface temperature of a star
*   Total energy given off by the star (total light emitted by star or absolute magnitude)

The mass of the star can be estimated using the closeness of spectral lines, surface temperature and absolute magnitude of the star which locates them on the HR diagram and allows distance from observer to be calculated (I proportional to 1/d<sup>2</sup>). The estimated mass can then be used to approximate the volume and radius of the star. Assuming spherical, V = 4/3πr<sup>3</sup> and density can be found using m/v. Lower density, giant stars produce finer absorption lines while higher density, smaller stars produce fuzzier ones due to  more free movement of atoms and ions that are absorbing the radiation and lower surface gravity.

**Chemical composition **

The measurement of a star's spectra indicates chemical composition through analysis of the wavelengths (coloured bands). The 92 chemical elements have their own characteristic emission/absorption lines eg: Hydrogen w/ 4 wavelengths that it emits/absorbs. If these 4 wavelengths are present in a star's spectrum, Hydrogen is present in its chemical composition as part of compound or gas. When the sun's spectrum was analysed in 1868, some bands observed did not fit any earthen element. It was believed this element was sun exclusive = helium. Most stars have similar solar spectrums, any small differences indicate important info about the star. Our sun is 71% hydrogen, 27% helium and &lt;2% other. over 65 elements detected in our sun.  Top 10 elements of our sun's composition are Oxygen 0.97%, carbon 0.4%, nitrogen 0.1%, silicon 0.1%, mg 0.08%, neon 0.06%, Fe 0.014%, Sulfur 0.04%. Other stars and nebulae have approx. 90% hydrogen, 10% helium and traces of other.


## _IQ: What evidence supports the particle model of light and what are the implications of this evidence for the development of the quantum model of light?_


## Quantum Model of Light

**Blackbodies **

Blackbodies are an ideal surface which completely absorbs and emits all wavelengths of EMR. It is a theoretical concept which can be approximated by a cavity that has its interior walls blackened with a small hole in one side to place a temperature probe in (oven/ furnace). as radiation falls on the hole from the outside, it will pass through. After passing, radiation is absorbed by the interior surface and when emitted (escapes through hole), the** EMR emitted depends only on the temperature of the cavity and is not affected by the size of the cavity nor by the materials the cavity is made from.**

The EMR emitted by a blackbody at a constant temperature is called blackbody radiation.

The black body is an ideal object, not a real one and approximations are used in physics. The sun is close to a perfect blackbody as blackbodies are perfect emitters as well as absorbers because they absorb the wavelengths that they also emit. At higher temperatures the larger intensity of shorter wavelengths changes the colour of the black body from red to orange, yellow, white and blue as temperature increases.

The black body model was founded on the blackbody and is used to calculate the temperature of distant objects.

**The Blackbody Spectrum**

As temperature increases, the peak is higher on the intensity graph, shifts left and wavelength decreases.

Note: mK is metre Kelvin, not milli Kelvin

Inconsistency: Wien's displacement law was a successful model since it predicted the position of the peak wavelength. However, there were two problems: 1. there was no theory explaining the curve shape of the intensity vs wavelength. 2. Wien's law was based on an ideal black body. Could this theoretical model represent the surface of a star?

Classical physics predicted (black line) that intensity would increase infinitely as wavelength decreased into infinity however, when experiments were done, intensity dipped when it reached the UV spectrum despite a shorter wavelength, resulting in a curve. This could not be explained using classical physics and a new theory was required to solve this problem of 'the ultraviolet catastrophe.' As temperature increases, total energy should increase. Shorter wavelengths should approach infinity.

In 1900, Planck began the era of quantum mechanics, a new branch of physics. His theory matched the experimental results with his formula

He proposed that the vibrational energy of atoms in a blackbody was emitted or absorbed in discrete packets, or quanta. Rather than a continuous release of energy, at the peak temperature, a specific quanta escapes with a certain amount of energy (multiple of the Planck energy) (E = nhf). Einstein theorised that light was also quantised in the same way, calling the ‘packets’ photons and using it to explain the photoelectric effect (E = hf)

As heat inside increased, at each temperature a new packet of energy is released.

Formulas:

E = hf, where h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34) and f is frequency of EMR in Hz, E is energy of a quantum of light (J or eV)

E = hc/λ, where c is the speed of light (3 x10<sup>8</sup>), λ is wavelength, h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup>)

f = c/λ, where c is the speed of light (3 x10<sup>8</sup>), f is frequency (Hz) and λ is wavelength (m)

p = h/λ where p is momentum (Nm), h is Planck’s constant, λ is wavelength (m)

KE<sub>max</sub> = hf – (work function)

Wien’s Law: λ<sub>max</sub> = b/T, where b is Wien’s displacement constant, T is surface temperature

**Photoelectric Effect, Photon Model, Law of Conservation of Energy**

Planck’s quantum hypothesis that energy was emitted and absorbed in discrete amounts. Albert Einstein put physical meaning into Planck’s quantum hypothesis by explaining the photelectric effect as the evidence for quantisation (E =hf). The Photoelectric effect is the ejection of electrons from an electrode by incident light (aka light that is shone at a specific frequency onto a piece of metal causes electrons to flow or if a certain metal plate is irradiated with light at a certain frequency, an electron will be ejected which can be detected when it interacts with a positively charged wire). The light must have a minimum/threshold/critical/cut off frequency (f<sub>0</sub>) for the electron to be emitted (x intercept of max kinetic energy vs frequency on graph). The ability for the electron to be ejected depends only on frequency and not on intensity. If the photon energy is greater than the work function this goes into the kinetic energy of the released electron.

Philip Lenard observed that the frequency of the light caused a photocurrent through shining UV light through a quartz screen onto a zinc plate with variable voltage inside a vacuum tube and observing the current induced.

Experiment:

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image28.png "image_tooltip")


He observed that the photoelectric current (same as the rate of emission of electrons) is directly proportional to the intensity of light falling on the electrode but, to obtain zero current, the voltage has to be reversed to a certain V<sub>0</sub> known as the stopping potential. The voltage must be reversed to such an extent that the electrons cannot reach the anode. This is the maximum kinetic energy an emitted electron can achieve. He found that the intensity of the light did not impact their energy.   The larger the number of electrons, the greater the photocurrent. The intensity of light is the number of incident photons (no. photons hitting metal) not frequency.

Einstein in 1905 used a model with two new ideas to explain the photoelectric effect: 1921 Nobel Prize



1. Law of conservation of energy
2. Planck’s quantisation (E =hf) of light photons

Einstein’s model has:



1. Energy of light is unevenly spread out over wavefront but concentrated in ‘packets’ or ‘bursts’ (photon)
2. Each photon has energy given by E =hf, it cannot possess all amounts of energy, rather it is limited by certain discrete values hence causing ‘packets’
3. A photon could give up all or none of its energy to one electron. The photon could not give a part of its energy (wave model of light said energy could build up) i.e. all or nothing
4. One photon can liberate one electron as long as it can overcome the work function – there is no time gap

It explained how electrons could be ejected with very low intensity incident light at the right frequency, because it only takes one photon at the right energy to knock out an electron and also how increasing the intensity, increased the current but not the stopping voltage as greater intensity means more photons, but not more energetic photons – therefore more interactions produce more current but the average energy of the electrons is unchanged. It also explained why increasing the frequency caused the stopping voltage to be increased linearly as a greater frequency $\rightarrow$ greater energy of photons (E = hf) therefore each photon can transfer more energy to an electron.

Example analogy:

Electron sitting on a solar panel. No electricity flowing as electron doesn’t move without light but, once sunlight hits the electron at the right frequency NOT INTENSITY then the electron moves and electricity starts flowing (enough energy to move away from atom) above threshold the electron will have more energy but the electron has maximum KE. It doesn’t build up, meaning that if you shine wrong frequencies on it, it doesn’t make small amounts of energy build up so it moves, rather nothing happens.

Photons have wave-particle duality, meaning that they have both the properties of a wave and a particle.

On a graph with KE on the y axis and frequency on the x axis, the threshold frequency is the x intercept value whereas the work function is the negative y intercept value. All three lines have the same slope, Planck’s constant.

The quantum model resolves the UV catastrophe as

Law of Conservation of Energy:

hf = KE<sub>max</sub> + ф $\rightarrow$ total photon energy = maximum energy converted into kinetic energy of electron + energy required to overcome electron binding forces

Work function: E = hf<sub>0 </sub>(y intercept of max kinetic energy vs frequency on graph) $\rightarrow$ minimum energy/energy at threshold

## IQ 4 Special Relativity

In 1905, Einstein wrote 4 papers, one was on special relativity which did away with the aether (the medium assumed light travelled through) and there was no absolute reference frame. Einstein’s special relativity was based on two postulates (propositions). Special relativity only concerns things in uniform motion or stationary (inertial frames of reference).



1. Principle of Relativity

    The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (at rest or at constant velocity) frames of reference i.e. no aether was required as there is no absolute reference frame for which to compare our motion to, everything is relative there is no universal direction. You cannot do an experiment to determine whether you are stationary or in constant motion. (both observers and movers have to insist they are not moving)

2. The speed of light [c] has the same value in all inertial frames in a vacuum. The speed of light does not depend on the speed of the source or the observer (speed doesn’t matter whether I’m moving the torch or not). C is constant in a vacuum.

They intended to find the aether through showing that light’s speed was different when they rotated the set-up (aether remained in the same direction) as one direction would be in the direction of the aether wind (faster) and one direction would be going against it (slower) thus, causing a change in the interference pattern as when the reflected rays combined they would move at different speeds. However, there was none.

Result: null result

Light was thought to require a medium (aether which was considered to be fixed), stars and planets were believed to be moving through the aether. Einstein’s 1<sup>st</sup> postulate did away with the aether. The null result did not support the hypothesis.

For postulate 2, c is constant regardless of frame of reference of observer and source of light

0.1 - 0.9c the bigger the difference between two events (same frame = same speed but once different speed then things happen to time)

Simultaneity – two observers may disagree on simultaneous nature of event

Speed of light in a vacuum is constant

Time Dilation

The reduction in the rate at which time passes in a frame moving in relative motion to the observer

T always bigger that T<sub>0</sub> bottom constant always less than 1. Bottom c<sup>2</sup> will cancel

Faster through space, slower through time


## Spacetime

Spacetime includes 3 dimensions of space (depth (z), length (y), width (x)) and 1 dimension of time (t), 4 dimensions in total. These 4 dimensions coordinate events in spatial reference at a specific time. All inertial frames have this.

It reinforces Postulate 2.

Time and distance are relative, meaning that time and distance have different values depending on measurement by different observers in different frames of reference. As c = d/t, distance and time must adjust so c remains constant. Physicists agree that there are no observations that contradict Einstein’s two postulates. However, like all theories, it will continually be tested and used until new evidence modifies them.


## Time Dilation and Length Contraction

Einstein’s two postulates of special relativity mean that observers in two inertial frames disagree on measurements. Moving clocks run slow since c is a constant, time appears to slow in a moving frame when compared with a stationary frame. Only by measuring different lengths and/at times, could observers measure light to be travelling the same velocity in each frame.

When V approaches 0.1c to 0.9c time dilation becomes observable. Time would stop if you travelled at c, nothing is found that can travel at this speed.

Describe: George Fitzgerald and Hendrik Lorentz

Before Einstein independently suggested an alternative explanation for the null result of the Aether experiment from Michelson and Morley. Their explanation was that all objects shrink in the direction of motion relative to the stationary Aether by a factor. Lorentz saw it as a physical contraction of objects, Einstein said there was no physical change in length of high-speed objects but rather a change in time and perception of space however, factor is correct. Today the equation is known as the Lorentz Factor or Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction.

where t = time measured in frame of reference in relative motion (outside observer looking in. Always larger than t<sub>0</sub>.

 Where t<sub>0</sub> = proper time or real time where time measured and observer travel at the same velocity (in the same reference frame), it is always smaller than t.

Where the denominator is the Lorentz factor which is always less than 1. c is speed of light, v is speed of moving frame of reference.

## Evidence:

**Observation of Cosmic Origin Muons at Earth’s Surface**

When Einstein proposed the theory of time dilation in 1905 there was no experimental evidence, since that time, a large amount of experimental evidence has been collected. Muons are sub atomic particles created by cosmic ray collisions (sunlight beams collide) 15km above the Earth’s surface (upper atmosphere). The muon is unstable, a stationary Muon has an average lifetime measured by an atomic clock of 2.196 micro seconds. Muons travel at 0.9997c.

How can we detect muons on Earth if they theoretically decay before they reach the Earth’s surface? Time dilation. Using s = vt, from perspective of the muon, s = 0.9997 x 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> x 2.196 x 10<sup>4</sup>, the muon should only be able to travel 658 m. But, measured from earth…

**Atomic Clocks - Hafele-Keating Experiment**

In 1971 they performed the Hafele-Keating experiment to test Einstein’s theory of relativity and time dilation. There are 4 Caesium atomic clocks, 2 in jet planes that flew twice around the world and 2 on the ground. The jet planes first flew east (same direction as the Earth’s rotation) and then flew west.

Time dilation theory states a greater time dilation occurs when the jet planes flew west because there is a greater relative motion (v) between the earth and the jet.

 It was predicted that clocks that flew east would lose 40ns (time on moving clock is less than earth clock/ran slow) and clocks that flew west would have a time dilation of 275ns (time on earth clock is slower than time of moving clock as the earth clock is moving with the earth (earth’s velocity + plane) but the plane is moving against the rotation of the earth (plane-earth’s velocity) thus, in relation, the earth clock travels faster than plane clock as higher speed = higher time dilation). When the planes landed, the actual results were 10% of the calculated prediction and therefore experimentally confirmed time dilation.

**Particle Accelerators**

Time dilation has been tested in high speed particle accelerators such as Large Hadron Collider. As **the speed of the charged particles such as protons approach c**, **an increase in the lifespan of subatomic particles** has been measured and time dilation confirmed (same as Muon phenomena). This provides experimental evidence for predictions of the theory of special relativity (time dilation formula, length contraction formula).

Experimental evidence for predictions of the theory of special relativity (time dilation formula, length contraction formula) can be observed in experiments from **cosmological studies**. The behaviour of light from distant supernovas, binary stars, gamma rays all confirm Einstein’s theory. Speed of gamma rays emitted from radioactive decay show when subatomic particles travel near c. The gamma rays emitted also travel at c to an observer.

Explain

Light from binary stars reach earth at c, their relative motion changes f of light but not v.

Supernovae decay products (particles) from the explosion travel at 3% c and light reaches the earth and perpendicular to the line of sight from earth at the same time. If velocity of the source changed the speed of c, the light emitted from particles moving towards the earth would reach the earth faster but, they do not.

Reinforces postulate 1.


## Consequences and Applications of Relativistic Momentum (Momentum dilation)

When an object moves at speeds much less than c, it has a Newtonian momentum (p = mv). As the object moves at relativistic speeds (0.1c+) it will have a greater momentum. As we approach c, we must modify Newtonian mechanics to account for the relative nature of space, time and momentum.

**Relativistic momentum can be derived from Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law.**

Where:

P<sub>v</sub> is the relativistic momentum of an object moving at v measured by an observer in Ns<sup>-1 </sup>or Kg<sup>-1</sup>m<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>

P<sub>v</sub> always > P<sub>0</sub>

m<sub>0</sub>V is the Newtonian momentum, a low speed approximation of a body in momentum.



*   m<sub>0</sub> is the rest mass of the object unaffected by **mass dilation**. It is measured in the frame of the object.

**Mass dilation: **mass is a relative quantity. Objects will have a greater mass when in motion at relativistic speeds (0.1-0.9c) in comparison to when it is stationary due to relativistic momentum.

As an object approaches **_c_** the relativistic momentum P<sub>v</sub> approaches infinity.  mass approaches infinity due to mass dilation. i.e. P<sub>v</sub> approaches 0 when object approaches c, so mv approaches infinity. Thus, we can never reach the speed of light as the momentum of the proton approaches infinity causing a loss in speed.

P<sub>v</sub> has been confirmed in the LHC in collisions between sub-atomic particles. The relativistic momentum of protons travelling at 99.999999%c is 8000x greater than the P = mv predicted by Newton. These protons have a mass 8000x greater than a proton at rest.


## Limitation on Maximum Velocity of a particle imposed by SR

An infinite amount of force will be required to accelerate an object to c therefore, it is impossible for a material object to travel at c with respect to an observer thus, c is the speed limit of the universe. Time dilation and length contraction also indicate c as the natural velocity limit.

An object approaching c has its time slowed to 0 and length in direction of motion contract to one plane (height and depth remain the same but, length contracts). From the object’s frame of reference, the universe rushes towards the object, time approaches 0 and universe would shrink to a plane in the direction of motion.

For a light photon, time has no meaning and the universe has shrunk to a plane in direction of photon’s motion, the photon is at the start and end of its journey simultaneously, there is nowhere to go and no time passes. The photon is annihilated (created and destroyed simultaneously at one point in spacetime)

From the Earth’s frame of reference, we see the photon travels approx. 8 minutes (our perspective), travelling at c (photon perspective, real speed) until it reaches its destination and disappearing when it gives its energy to an atom.

As an object approaches c, its relativistic mass increases, the energy supplied to make the object travel faster is converted to mass thus, stopping the photon from reaching c.


## Mass Energy Equivalence Relationship

Where E = energy in J

m = mass in kg or eV

c = speed of light is ms<sup>-1</sup>

In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) it is the energy of the particles that matter, not their mass. In the LHC, the more energy (potential/kinetic), the more massive the new particle that can be made.

**Production of Energy by the Sun (fusion)**

All stars convert mass to energy in their core by fusion reactions. 3 main fusion reactions are:



1.

![alt_text](https://hsc.one/statically-image-cdn/uploads/physics-hsc-consolidation-1/image32.gif "image_tooltip")


The above reactions have been in the sun for 5 billion years and have another 5 billion to go. Hydrogen nuclei are fused together and after several steps, helium nucleus is formed with the release of approx. 25 MeV.

SEE MOD 8

Our star is a 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> generation star, formed from remains of other stars that exploded earlier in our galaxy. As the nebulae contracted due to gravity, the pressure and temperature at the core sustained the above fusion reactions.

**Particle and Anti-Particle Interaction (Annihilation)**

Paul Dirac in the 1920s working on quantum mechanics suggested every particle had an anti-particle with the same mass but, opposite charge - except photons (massless). Eg: electron and positron

Positrons are produced when a proton decays to a neutron. If the positron collides with an e<sup>-</sup> annihilation occurs and two gamma rays (γ) are produced. Annihilation occurs in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

e<sup>−</sup> + e<sup>+</sup> → γ + γ

Charge is conserved i.e. (e<sup>-</sup>+e<sup>+</sup> = 0), gamma rays have no charge

Momentum is also conserved $\rightarrow$ momentum of e<sup>-</sup> + momentum of e<sup>+</sup> = momentum of γ rays.

**What about mass?**

The electron and positron both have mass, because γ rays do not – it may appear that mass is not conserved however,

<p id="gdcalert61" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert62">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

  shows the mass of the electron and positron are converted into energy aka γ rays.

**How is it used?**

PET scans: positron emission tomography



*   Radioisotopes are injected into the body tissues with glucose such as brain
*   Isotopes attach to glucose which can be detected as it causes γ rays to be emitted through annihilation
*   Patient is placed in a ring-shaped detector
*   Tissues with high activity have more γ rays emitted whereas places with low activity glow less under detection

5. Chemical composition

Conclusion:



1. Emission spectra are the distinctive wavelengths a certain element emits when in an excite gaseous state. They are produced through passing electricity through an elemental gas in a discharge tube, causing the gas to emit light. This light is then viewed through a spectroscope where a prism splits the light into its distinctive wavelengths, giving us information on the composition of certain compounds.
2. The Hydrogen spectrum consists of 4 coloured bands. From left to right there is: red (656nm), yellow-green (486nm), cyan (434nm) and violet (410nm).

# Module 8 From the Universe to the Atom

The Big Bang Theory (BBT) is used to explain formation of elements on the periodic table during 13.8 billion years and is an attempt to understand origin and development of the universe. According to the BBT, energy spread out from a singularity (a small point of high temperature and density) before the singularity? conjecture. Brian Smith disproved the collapsing universe theory through showing that the universe was expanding at an increasing rate. As energy spreads over increasing distances, the temperature greatly reduces from that of the singularity. Particles (Quarks, electrons, neutrons, protons) and forces mediated by particles (gravity $\rightarrow$ all particles, electrostatic $\rightarrow$ charged particles, weak nuclear forces $\rightarrow$ quarks, photons and leptons (electrons), strong nuclear forces $\rightarrow$gluon (bonds that hold quarks), quarks) all form out of energy. At lower temperatures d/t universe expansion, particles formed become stable and combine to form atoms/molecules – matter. Energy from singularity is all the energy in the universe and for 13.8 B years this energy has been transformed into radiation and matter observable today. Total amount of energy is the same as the beginning.

Atoms were thought to be the smallest, indivisible particles until electrons and radioactivity were discovered. Later experiments showed that protons and atoms were divisible and made from quarks but, electrons are not (elementary). There is an antiparticle for every particle, slightly more matter than antimatter was formed why? No idea. Most of what we detect today is matter not antimatter. Matter and anti-matter annihilate when they collide, when electron + positron = annihilated and 2 gamma rays released.

Energy left over from the BBT that did not form into matter can be detected as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). BBT predicts gamma rays due to expansion of the universe are seen as microwaves. Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias measured and confirmed this using COBE satellites.

Evidence is required to determine whether the universe is expanding, contraction or static. There are 3 models of the universe:

Flat universe – expansion slows and stopped

Open universe – expansion accelerates

Closed universe – expansion eventually reverses and contracts

Evidence:

Einstein’s general theory of relativity extended the special theory to accelerating reference frames and gravity (the warping of the fabric of spacetime). Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaitre predicted expansion of the universe. The space between galaxies is expanding i.e. like dots on a balloon therefore, BBT is not an explosion but an expansion of space as galaxies are not moving through space rather, space between them is expanding.

Evidence:

Hubble using Cepheid variable stars (intensity variable supergiants with a period related to luminosity) in the Andromeda Galaxy, expanded on Henrietta’s work which showed that the absolute velocity of the star and intensity of light reaching observer are known, the inverse square law can be used to find distance to the star. Finding distance to individual stars, Hubble calculated speeds of nebulae and galaxies from Earth by comparing wavelengths of spectral lines of atoms (Hydrogen) he noticed the elongation of wavelengths (red shift, nebulae moving away) due to the Doppler Effect.

Hubble Relationship:

The further away the galaxy, the faster it is moving away from Earth. GRAPH Recessional Velocity vs Distance

Gradient = H<sub>o</sub> Hubble’s constant (km/s/MPC)

∴ v =d/t, t = d/v = 1/H<sub>0</sub> = age of the universe

V = H<sub>0</sub>d

Where:

v = recessional velocity (km/s)

H<sub>0 </sub>= Hubble’s constant (70 km/s/MPC) estimate of universe’s speed of expansion, galaxy at a distance of 100 MPC is travelling from Earth at 7000km/s

D = distance to the galaxy (MPC)

Other evidence:

Red shift of nebulae

AU is distance from sun to the earth = 1.5 x 10 <sup>11</sup>m

## E = mc<sup>2</sup> and Nuclear Reactions in Stars



*   Energy converted into particles
*   Matter, anti-matter reactions in first minutes of BB
*   More matter than antimatter 1:1 B one extra particle per billion
*   That is all matter in present universe
*   Nuclear Synthesis produced Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium
*   300 000 yrs after BB, electrons combined with H, Li, He to form atoms
*   The next 13.8 B yrs, elements from He to Fe were produced by fusion reactions in core of stars
*   Elements heavier than Fe were produced in fusion reactions in supernova explosions
*   Our sun formed from the gravitational collapse of gas and dust from earlier supernova explosions and dead stars
*   Heavier earth elements eg: Pb were concentrated in terrestrial (rocky) planets
*   Stars first form 400 million years after BB from matter accretion d/t gravity
*   Fusion of H to He $\rightarrow$ early stars being very large and hot $\rightarrow$ burnt out quickly and supernova explosion
*   Calculations on the mass and energy output of our sun found amount of energy produced per atom was > 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> times energy produced by chemical reaction (combustion) rather it must come from E = mc<sup>2</sup> through fusion of H to He (mass-energy equivalence)

Emission:



*   Each transition has a specific colour (shell 6 to 2 is violet etc…) we can see everything until 2<sup>nd</sup> orbital how?? with new model of the atom

Evidence for expansion, fusion how does that prove BBT?

Absorption: specific wavelengths of light are missing from continuous spectrum (e = hf)

Blackbody radiation produces a continuous spectrum containing all wavelengths. As blackbody is heated, the wavelength of which most radiation is emitted decreases and power radiated increases (intensity) i.e. a spread of energies emitted. Therefore, as temperature increases, peak wavelength decreases $\rightarrow$ colour changes from warm to cool

Quantitated by Wien’s law:

Max wavelength = b/t

When peak wavelength of a spectrum is green, blue light is also emitted therefore, green is seen as white.

Absorption spectra from all stars is similar to our sun indicating similarity in chemical composition and reactions occurring within them (basic chemistry and physics applies throughout the universe). There are differences but no new lines have been discovered in other stars.

OBAFGKM – oh be a fine guy kiss me

Stars are classified by presence of absence of spectral lines.

Differences between star groups were due to atoms becoming ionised (losing electrons) at certain temperatures. At cooler temps (red stars) does not have enough energy to excite atoms enough for them to fuse and make new elements thus less spectral lines emitted.

Astrophysicists originally used an alphabetical system based on absorption spectra, the main difference for different absorption lines is due to star’s temperature. The updated classification system used is the Morgan Kennan System where same letters (OBAFGKM) are used but based on spectra lines produced and temperature (hot 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 cool) and subdivided further, temperature given numbers and luminosity is given roman numerals (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V). Our sun is G2V. It allows us to classify more stars in greater detail. Absorption is used as it does not require full atom, easier and more accurate. Use absorption to classify stars

Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1911 graphed absolute magnitude v colour. Henry Russell in 1913 graphed absolute magnitude of stars v spectral class. Both found that stars were grouped on the H-R diagram.

Using the naked eye, brightest stars were given absolute magnitude of 1. Less bright stars were positive values (1, 2, 3 least-brightest etc). Brighter stars were then discovered later and assigned negative values. Absolute magnitude is a measure of luminosity (all stars at the same distance). Relative magnitude measure how bright the star appears from earth (stars at different distances). Luminosity measures total energy radiated by a star per second (log scale). Represented by a number on the absolute magnitude scale (corresponds).

On the main sequence, stars fuse hydrogen $\rightarrow$ helium in their core and have a luminosity class of V, red giants fuse heavier elements and have luminosity of I, white dwarfs are hot, condensed remains of stars that have depleted nuclear fuel

Life cycle of a star:

Stellar nebula $\rightarrow$ average star $\rightarrow$ red giant $\rightarrow$ planetary nebula $\rightarrow$ white dwarf

OR

Stellar nebula $\rightarrow$ massive star $\rightarrow$ red supergiant $\rightarrow$ supernova $\rightarrow$ black hole OR neutron star (> 8SM)


## Types of Nucleosynthesis Reactions (making of atoms) in Main Sequence and Post-main Sequence Stars

Define:

Nucleosynthesis: nuclear fusion of light nuclei (H) to form heavier nuclei (He) with this process continuing. On earth we cannot do fusion commercially, only fission due to high pressure and energy require. This is possible because very high temperature and pressure in stars. Every element has been synthesised in the core of stars.

Describe:

Self-sustaining fusion reactions release more energy than required to start them/ignite (exothermic) eg: fusion reactions up to Fe (26), non-self-sustaining fusion reactions require larger amounts of energy and produce elements heavier than Fe (26). These occur in the core of supernovas (8x heavier than our sun) that collapse then explode or neutron star collisions.

Explain:

A star is composed of mainly H nuclei (<sup>1<sub>1</sub></sup> H) and He (<sup>4 <sub>2</sub></sup>He) nuclei (2 protons, 2 neutrons).

2 fusion reactions occur.

Main Sequence:

P-P Chain

In main sequence stars w/ mass &lt; 1.5 solar masses and core temperature of &lt; 18 000 000K. Fusion reactions occur to produce energy from fusing H and He (proton-proton chain) which is the main fusion reaction (85% of our sun’s energy). There are other P-P chain reactions, the sun produces 98% of its fusion reaction created energy using P-P chain reactions.

These reactions produce C and O atoms essential for life. Larger stars fuse heavier elements which require higher temperature and pressures to overcome the electrostatic forces. For the largest stars, fusion stops with core of Fe and gravity collapses the star, causing the star to supernova which provide the energy to fuse all other elements up to U(238). All elements produced are spread throughout the universe thus, allowing the creation of new stars. Very large stars (> 8SM) can collapse to form:



*   Neutron star – diameter of approx. 30km with same mass as our sun (very dense), all electrons and protons have collapsed to form neutrons (elements emitted)
    *   Pulsars – regular pulses of radio waves and visible light from a rotating neutron star
*   Black holes – (>20SM) even neutrons in a neutron star collapse due to the force of G being so strong, forming a singularity meaning a point of infinitely small volume and infinite density (more massive, the greater the gravity), even light can’t escape from it (black hole)

Every galaxy has a black hole at the centre.

Event horizon: radius around singularity where the escape velocity exceeds C

The discovery of the electron was made after decades of experimental observation and inferring models of the atom. In 1857 Heinrich Geissler invented the glass vacuum tube.

Cathode Rays

Discharge tube: A discharge tube has a vacuum inside and two metal electrodes, a cathode (five cent piece) (-) and anode (+). At standard temperature and pressure (STP) air is an insulator, at reduced pressure, air/all gases conduct electricity. Gases can also be made to conduct by passing electricity through it (100 000+ V).

Aim: what are the different properties of cathode rays that can be observed using discharge tubes?

**Deflection tube observations:** As per the RHR the cathode ray deflects when interacting with a magnet thus, the beam is different to light as light does not interact with a magnetic field. To react to a magnetic field as per the RHR, the ray must be charged.

**Maltese Cross tube observations:** When the cross is up a black shadow of the cross is projected on the anode side of the tube indicating the beam originates from the cathode (-) and that the cathode ray cannot pass by solid. Indicates that the cathode ray cannot bend 90<sup>o</sup> (travels in a straight line). Similar to light as it forms shadows, travels in straight lines and rays. When cross down, bright shadow due to different exposure of the anode glass to the ray.

**Paddle Wheel tube observations:** Indicates the cathode ray’s particles have mass, velocity and thus, momentum (they are physical) as the ray is physically hitting the wheel - applying an external force which makes the wheel turn. The particle’s energy is indicated through the glow of the phosphor fluorescent paint which indicates a transfer of energy and momentum from particle to paint.

**Explain what the shadow of the Maltese Cross suggests about the way Cathode rays travel. **

The shadow of the Maltese Cross occurs on the anode side of the cathode ray tube which indicates that the cathode ray is travelling from the cathode to the anode as if the ray from travelling in the direction from the anode to the cathode, the shadow would be projected on the cathode side of the discharge tube. The shadow also indicates that, like light – cathode rays cannot bend 90<sup>o</sup> because if they were able to bend 90<sup>o</sup>, the ray would reach the anode without being blocked by the Maltese Cross, hence no shadow would occur. The shadow also suggests that Cathode Rays cannot travel through solid objects, as they are blocked by the Maltese Cross hence, causing a shadow.

**Will Cathode rays be deflected if they are parallel to magnetic fields? Discuss.**

Cathode rays will not be deflected if they are parallel to a magnetic field as the charged particles must have a perpendicular component of their motion/velocity relative to the Magnetic field to experience a force, as per the RHR.

**What happens to the cathode ray when a magnetic field is brought close to the ray? Describe both North and South poles.**

When a magnetic field is brought close, perpendicular to the velocity of charged particle with the north pole closest to the cathode ray, the ray will experience an upwards force as per the RHR. With the south pole closest to the cathode ray, the ray will be deflected downwards as per the RHR.

**Why did we have to use the induction coil in this experiment?**

Our experiment requires a high voltage thus, an induction coil is required to increase the voltage of our power supply.

Cathode Rays



*   Cathode rays come out from the cathode (-) and connected to negative terminal of the induction coil.
*   Travel in straight lines (Maltese cross), particle and wave property
*   Cause glass to fluoresce a light green colour (vacuum)
*   Deflected by electric and magnetic fields (deflection tube) a charged particle property
*   Carry energy and momentum (paddle wheel) particle property
*   Yellow cathode ray is due to the ‘colour’ of the vacuum

Therefore, Cathode Rays (electrons) are particles with a wave-particle duality

Evaluate Thomson’s charge to mass experiment ½ page

Thomson’s Charge to mass experiment

In 1897, JJ Thomson proved cathode rays were electrons and measured their charge and mass (q:m ratio). The ratio is integral and = q:m = 1.76 x 10<sup>11</sup> C. Thus, the q:m ratio was used to prove the existence of electrons. The very high ratio showed that electrons had a large charge but miniscule mass.

Explain: Thomson used a cathode ray tube with two fields (parallel electric plates), magnetic field (electromagnet). The fields are 90<sup>o</sup> to each other.

Electric field deflects the cathodes ray up, magnetic field deflects cathode rays down. Electric field (F = qE) and magnetic field (F = qvbsinθ) are adjusted so that forces cancel out and the beam is undeflected. Undeflected beam is used to find velocity of cathode ray (qvB=qE) $\rightarrow$ v = E/B



1. F = qE = qvB
2. F<sub>B</sub> = qvB = F<sub>centripetal</sub> = mv<sup>2</sup>/r
3. qvB = mv<sup>2</sup>/r $\rightarrow$ q/m = V/Br

Millikan’s Milk Drop Experiment

His experiment proved that an electron’s energy was quantised (discrete packets, set amount), rather than continuous. Crucial part of our understanding of the electron

Describe: Experiment consisted of two chambers with a pinhole linking them. An atomiser (produces a fine mist of oil droplets) was sprayed into the top chamber and oil drops drift down, leaving the atomiser, oil drops were charged by friction or by X Rays to further ionise oil drops and increase oil drop charge. Oil was used because it had a higher vapour pressure (would not evaporate as fast in the chamber). Microscope allowed observation of oil droplets drifting down into the second chamber which was connected to a power source and had an Electric field.

F<sub>mg</sub>= F<sub>qE</sub>

mg = qE

mg = q x V/d as E = V/d

q = mgd/V where q = charge on oil drop, m = mass of oil drop, V= potential difference used to stop oil falling, d = distance separating charged plates, g = gravity

m was known, Millikan used above to calculate the oil drop’s charge.

Analyse: Millikan found the smallest unit of charge to be -1.592 x 10<sup>-19</sup>C (one electron rubbed on the oil drop), within 1% of today’s value of -1.602 x 10<sup>-19</sup>C. Oil drops could have larger electric charge but only existed as multiples of this base unit of charge. Crucial to our understanding of electrons.

JJ Thomson’s q:m ratio of the electron was explained by Millikan’s experiment. That Cathode Rays were negatively charged particles $\rightarrow$ electrons. Millikan’s oil drop experiment quantified electron charge as -1.602 x 10<sup>19</sup>C. This led to the calculation of the charge on the proton (size of positive charge), positron and mass of electron.

m = 0.035 x 10<sup>-9</sup>

d =  0.03m

v = 5500 V

1.87x 10<sup>-15</sup> C, bigger than value of electron as more electrons removed

Experimental Evidence Supporting the Nuclear Model of the Atom

JJ Thomson’s plum pudding atomic model (atom of positive charge w/ electrons scattered inside) had:



1. mass of atom spread out over its area
2. the sea of positive charge (pudding)
3. electrons embedded in the pudding

Experimental observation altered this model

8.2.2 Geiger-Marsden Experiment

In 1905, Geiger and Marsden working under Rutherford performed an experiment where alpha particles (alpha radiation, the He atom w/o electrons) was fired at thing gold leaf. Gold was used because a very thin layer of atoms was required and gold can be pressed into a several atoms thick foil.

Results:



*   Most alpha particles passed through with only small deflection but 1/8000 were deflected by angles greater than 90<sup>o </sup>$\rightarrow$ due to hitting ‘something’ aka the nucleus
*   In Thomson’s model there should have been no deflection whatsoever hence, this experiment provided evidence for the nucleus

*   ‘it was as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you’
*   Rutherford concluded that alpha particles were deflected through large particles because all the atom’s positive charge and nearly all of its mass was concentrated in a small dense nucleus with electrons orbiting around the nucleus like planets around the sun. From the results of alpha particles, scattering experiments, Rutherford estimated the atom size as having a diameter of

    1 x 10<sup>-10</sup>m and nucleus of diameter 1 x 10<sup>-14</sup>m

*   Significant/crucial. He was the first to propose the existence of the nucleus, separate from electron motion. Limitations include organisation of electrons and inability to explain why despite electrons accelerating, they did not radiate energy and fall into the nucleus (could not explain electron stability)

Chadwick’s Discovery of the Neutron

After Rutherford (1908-1911) it seemed logical to assume the nucleus contained protons and electrons orbited outside the nucleus. There were major problems with this idea i.e. mass of the nucleus was 2x the atomic number (Z) and the de Broglie wavelength was large compared to small radius of the atom. Rutherford proposed the neutron.

In 1930s Walter Boheff and Becca found passing particles through Beryllium gave a type of unknown radiation. In 1932 James Chadwick identified this radiation as Rutherford’s neutral particles $\rightarrow$ neutrons

Neutrons get trapped in the Paraffin wax but, dislodge Protons. For Protons to be dislodged, they must have been hit by something of same mass.

Uncharged neutrons were difficult to detect, a gas chamber detected Protons since Protons can ionise (remove electrons) gas $\rightarrow$ electricity flows, current detected as electrons are moving. Paraffin wax constitutes of Hydrogen atoms and was used because the unknown radiation could knock Protons out of it. By applying conservation laws of momentum/energy to the interaction of a Neutron with a proton (neutron mass similar to proton) Chadwick was able to prove existence of the neutron. Chadwick correctly assumed the alpha radiation produced neutrons by transmuting () the Beryllium nucleus to a carbon nucleus.

momentum before = momentum after

m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>u<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>

neutron + proton = neutron + proton

m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1 </sub>+ 0 = 0 + m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>

Why can classical physics no explain the properties of the atom?

Zeeman found that splitting of spectral lines was caused by a magnetic field (not only hyperfine lines) due to electron’s magnetic field (spin) and orbital motion (Maxwell’s Formulas) which interacts with applied Magnetic field. Interaction of two magnetic fields creates a force that gives transition more energy, separating the spectral lines.

Bohr’s model introduced the idea of quantised energy shell levels, n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 (whole numbers) but did not explain why they were quantised. Successful models have both predictive and explanatory power. Bohr’s model lacked explanatory power and limited predictive power (Hydrogen) leading to Schrodinger and Heisenberg’s quantum models using de Broglie’s work as a framework.

Line Emission Series and Balmer Series in H

The emission spectra (EMR emitted when electrons excited) emit light in full UV and visible range. Hydrogen atoms have series of 4 spectral lines representing specific wavelengths through colour.

In 1885 Balmer find the wavelengths of spectra of Hydrogen using:

Rydberg/Balmer Equation

1/λ = R (1/n<sup>2<sub>f </sub></sup>– 1/n<sup>2<sub>i</sub></sup>) where λ is wavelength (determined by transition), R is Rydberg’s constant ( on formula sheet, n<sub>f</sub> is final orbital electron ends up in (smaller value), n<sub>i</sub> is initial shell the electron is located in (whole numbers)

Find reciprocal at the end.

We only see the Balmer series because EMR is released in visible spectrum. Paschen series, Lyman series, Brackett series, PFund series release EMR in non-visible spectrums.

Ground state is always lowest energy shell. LBPaBrP, LbePabePa

Line Emission Spectrum of Hydrogen, Quantised Energy and the Law of Conservation of Energy

The Balmer Series for H is caused by electrons moving from higher (n<sub>i</sub>) to lower energy shells (n<sub>f</sub>) of 2.

E = hf allows energy difference between shells to be calculated.

When and electron changes energy shells (from higher to lower), it emits energy in form of EMR or absorbs energy (lower to higher):

E = E<sub>i</sub> – E<sub>f</sub> = hf = hc/λ

Ionisation is the removal of an electron from an atom so that electrostatic attraction is negligible. Ground energy level of the atom $\rightarrow$ electron in the orbit with the smallest radius (1<sup>st</sup> shell). The energy of the photon released and its frequency (E = hf) when the electron changes energy shells is given by:

E = E<sub>1</sub> – E<sub>2</sub> = hf, v = fλ, E = hf $\rightarrow$ f = v/λ $\rightarrow$ E = hv/λ = hc/λ

The most energy is required to elevate electron from ground state to first excited shell.

The process of photon emission is governed by the law of conservation of energy (LCE), that is energy cannot be created nor destroyed- only transformed from one form to another. When an electron moves from a higher to a lower orbital, LCE states that lost energy is transformed to EMR with a frequency. Energy of the photon is E = hf. If the proton was absorbed by another electron, the electron would move to a higher orbital.

Experimental Evidence of de Broglie’s Matter Waves

De Broglie wins the 1929 Nobel Prize for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons that explained their stability. De Broglie proposed that particles (electrons, protons, neutrons that form matter) have wave-particle duality. To describe wave-particle duality quantitatively, the formula can be derived from Einstein’s E = mc<sup>2</sup> and Planck’s E = hf.

E = mc<sup>2</sup> = hf

hc/λ = mc<sup>2</sup>

λ = h/mc where λ is wavelength of particle (m), m is mass (Kg), mc is momentum of the particles (Ns or Kgms<sup>-1</sup>)

LHS λ $\rightarrow$ wave properties, RHS mc $\rightarrow$ momentum $\rightarrow$ particle property

λ = h/mv

The wave-particle duality is not limited to photons. De Broglie believed particles has properties similar to waves and replaced c with v of any particle. Any particle with momentum can have a wavelength and behave like a wave (matter wave). The wavelength of any particle with mv can be found. Wavelengths formed by large (1kg&lt;) have very small wavelengths that are unable to be witnessed with human vision.

Nickel crystal acts as a diffraction grating (unexpectedly due to anneal) $\rightarrow$ electrons gave diffraction pattern similar to X-Rays. Diffraction have been seen with neutrons, He and alpha where λ matches de Broglie’s predictions.

As angle θ was changed, a diffraction pattern was made. Diffraction is a wave property. Wavelengths measured from electron diffraction; interference patterns matched De Broglie’s (λ = h/mv) predictions, confirming his matter-wave theory. George Thomson fired a beam of electrons through a thin gold foil and observed diffraction rings thus, 2 teams using different experiments, proved the wave nature of electrons thus, proving De Broglie’s proposal.

Applying matter waves to the electrons of an atom:

Quantised energy levels of the H atom

Bohr’s postulate (electrons move in integer orbits) around the nucleus without radiating energy. This observed stability Bohr was unable to explain. De Broglie’s matter waves explained the stability of electrons i.e. electrons moving in standing waves round nucleus, electron is on wave. If an electron sets up a standing wave around the nucleus, the circumference is 2πr and there are a whole number of wavelengths (number contained depends on circumference of orbital).

nλ = 2πr (sub de Broglie λ = h/mv) $\rightarrow$nh/mv = 2πr $\rightarrow$ mvr = nh/2π (thus, angular momentum is quantised)

Bohr’s fourth postulate for angular momentum (L is quantised) thus, confirming de Broglie’s matter-wave.

How does the standing wave become an orbital?

The two ends are connected. Standing wave allows energy to be quantised, stability due to Bohr’s fourth postulate. In a standing wave there is no acceleration thus, no EMR.


## Schrodinger’s contribution to the model

From the 1920s, modern quantum mechanics was developed by Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger.

From 1925 Schrodinger made a significant contribution using de Broglie’s matter wave properties to produce the first full quantum model of the atom.

HΨ = EΨ (where Ψ is wave function that tells location of the particle, E is particle energy, H is Hamiltonian that is a constant) shows how electrons reside in an electron cloud

Schrodinger’s model overcame most of the limitations of Bohr’s model and formed the basis of our current model of the atom. Schrodinger’s wave equation^ gives the position of the electrons as probability clouds rather than in a circular orbit.

Special relativity, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (on the quantum level, knowing the position of the particle, the momentum will be unknown as the particle has been disturbed by the detection device), Pauli’s exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom will have exactly the same quantum numbers i.e. electron spin (m<sub>s</sub>), angular momentum (l), magnetic moment (m, the induced magnetic field of electron’s orbital movement), orbital number (n)) into Schrodinger’s model which explains how so many electrons can be located closely in clouds as the exclusion principle means no two electrons are going to completely repel (almost all quantum numbers are direction, only n is a number)

Model is imperfect (not agreed on interpretation on wave function, what is waving?). Allows us to find probability of finding an electron in an orbital.


## Properties of the Nucleus

Spontaneous Decay of Unstable Nuclei and the Properties of alpha, beta and gamma.

Nucleons – what’s inside the nucleus, protons and neutrons. Negative electrons surround the nucleus.

Atomic number (z number) – number of protons in the nucleus = electrons in neutral atom

Mass number (A) – number of protons + neutrons (nucleons)

Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons. Isotopes are chemically identical but, have different physical properties. A radio-isotope is unstable and emits particles α (<sup>4<sub>2</sub></sup>H) and β (e<sup>-</sup>) until they become stable. Unstable nuclei release high energy radiation $\rightarrow$ ionising radiation. Spontaneous decay is a loss of mass (∆m = mass defect) as some mass is converted into energy (E = mc<sup>2</sup>) eg: α (<sup>4<sub>2</sub></sup>H) and β (e<sup>-</sup>) decay. This changes a radio-isotope into a different element (transmutation). γ radiation (high energy EMR) is also emitted from unstable nuclei

**8.4.2 Half-Life**

The activity of a radioactive isotope is measured using half-lives (t½). Half-life: time for nuclei to undergo decay until half of its original mass is retained. For example: Polonium 238 has a half-life of 3min therefore, after 3min half of the original radio-isotope remains. As time progresses a smaller and smaller amount of the original radio-isotope remains.

The number of particles remaining is found using: N<sub>t</sub> = N<sub>o</sub>e<sup>-λt </sup>where N<sub>t</sub> is number of radioactive nuclei remining at time t, n<sub>o</sub> is starting number of nuclei, t is time period for one half-life, e is the e constant

λ = ln2/t½ where t½ is half-life, λ is decay constant (units of time given)

n = t/t½ NOT ON FORMULA SHEET

A = A<sub>0</sub> (1/2)<sup>n</sup> NOT ON FORMULA SHEET

The activity is the number of decays per second that occurs in a sample of radioactive material. It is measured in becquerel (Bq) where 1 Bq = 1 decay per second

Curve of number of nuclides remaining vs number of half-life is an exponential decay curve of N<sub>o</sub>e<sup>-λt</sup>

Finding decay constant:

λ = ln2/t½ or n = t/t½


## 8.4.3 Nuclear Fission Controlled eg: nuclear reactor in a power plant

Name and define: Nuclear fission occur when an atom splits into two lighter nuclei (atom), mass is converted into energy (E = mc<sup>2</sup>) (heat). Nuclear fission reactors release energy at a controlled rate (thermal reactor).  Neutrons incite fission. Nuclear fission: when a heavy atom is bombarded with neutrons, U-235 absorbs one neutron which forms a highly unstable compound nucleus which splits into two approximately equal elements and releases 3 neutrons.

What is a nuclear reactor composed of?



1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fuel core </span>– nuclear fuel contains fissionable material (materials that can split upon absorbing a neutron) i.e. Uranium is made up of 3 isotopes, 99% is U-238, 0.7% is **U-235**, 0.006% is U-234. Only U-235 is fissionable (yellow cake) as it undergoes fission immediately whereas U-238 is fertile material since it can be converted by neutron capture that causes decay to Plutonium-239 before splitting thus, non-fissionable. Most reactor fuel is a mixture of U-235 and U-238.
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Moderator </span>– Neutrons released by a chain reaction (Fission reaction, eg: U to Krypton and Barium, Caesium and Rubidium or Lanthanum and Bromine) need to be slowed down. Slower neutrons interact more efficiently with a U-235 atom i.e. increases chances of fission with slower neutrons. This is done so by impeding their exit pathway and allowing neutrons to collide with atoms that don’t absorb neutrons (moderator) (water, graphite or heavy water)
3. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Control rods </span>– the chain reaction can be controlled by lowering control rods that absorb neutrons in the reactor core, usually steel containing Boron/Cadmium which capture neutrons w/o undergoing fission. Removing the control rods from the reactor allows for an increase in rate of fission. Lowering control rods into reactor core, lowers fission rate.
4. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Coolant</span>- most of the energy in fission reactions are carried away by the fission products (Barium, Krypton, 3 neutrons) which collide with the coolant (water, helium – some can also be the moderator) and produces heat. The coolant removes heat.
    1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Primary coolant</span> –<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>never leaves the reactor and is highly radioactive
    2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Secondary Coolant </span>–<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>eg: water from a nearby natural source through a heat exchange process, heat is removed from the primary coolant and the secondary coolant turns to steam which spins a **turbine to produce electricity which is the point of the reactor.** Held in a cooling pond before being returned to the reactor or released back to water source once temperature is back to 20-25<sup>o</sup>C
5. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Radiation Biological Shield</span> – to reflect neutrons back to into the centre and the protect walls of the reactor from radiation. Made from high density concrete, 2-3m thick.

**Controlled Fission** has a 1:1 ratio to prevent a runaway reaction

**Uncontrolled fission reaction (nuclear bomb)**

Each released neutron is allowed to induce fission in three other uranium-235 atoms. There is an exponential build up of atoms undergoing fission leading to a runaway explosion (large release of energy). Requirements:



*   Enriched fuel 100% U-235
*   No control rods
*   No moderator
*   No coolant
*   No shield

Example of Uranium fission:

**8.4.5 Nuclear Fusion**

Name and define: As in alpha, beta, fission and fusion reactions the atomic number (Z) and mass number (A) on both sides of the equation sum up to equal each other (conserved). Mass number and charge are confused.



<p id="gdcalert137" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert138">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



Nuclear fusion is the combining of smaller nuclei to form heavier nuclei, extremely high temperatures are required. A small amount of mass is lost during fusion as energy (binding energy). Nuclei are positively charged (no electrons) and repel due to electrostatic forces. In fusion reactions, approaching nuclei must have enough speed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion forces to get close enough for the strong nuclear force to take effect. The energy barrier is the energy required to overcome the electrostatic repulsion force (lower than energy released per nucleon in fusion). Energy released in fusion is greater than fission, with no radioactive waste, no pollution eg: National Ignition Facility.

Nuclear transmutation is the process of one element changing into another element through nuclear reactions.

Natural transmutation is when radioactive isotopes spontaneously decay over a period of time and transform into other more stable isotopes.

Artificial transmutation occurs when a nuclear reaction is triggered by one of the reactants.

8.4.6 Energy from Nuclear Reactions

Name and define: mass of a nucleus (A) is always less than the sum of the mass of its individual nucleons eg: two separate protons and two separate neutrons will have slightly greater mass than a

<p id="gdcalert138" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert139">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

 nucleus. The mass of the atom is less than the sum of the masses of its components (protons, neutrons, electrons).The mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its components (protons, neutron)

Describe: the large energy involved in nuclear reactions fission and fusion is due to Einstein’s E = mc<sup>2</sup>

Mass defect = constituent nucleons – mass of nucleus (A)

∆m = mass of protons, neutrons, electrons – atomic mass

Convert to AU

Mass MUST in kg for E = mc<sup>2</sup> . Binding energy per nucleon

Find mass defect of U–235

92 protons x 1.007224 = 92.66465984

92 electrons x 0.000548 = 0.050453

143 neutrons x 1.008429 = 144.205298

Mass defect = 236.9204 – 235.0439 = 1.87648084

E = mc<sup>2</sup>

= 1.876480 x 1.661 x 10<sup>-27</sup> x (3 x 10<sup>8</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

= …

Binding energy per nucleon:

Mass defect x 931.5 MeV (data sheet)

= 1747.8 MeV (in one nucleus)

= 7.438 MeV per nucleon (divided by no. of protons and neutrons, mass number)

**Binding Energy**

Binding energy is defined as the energy needed to separate the atom into its constituent parts. During nuclear reaction (fusion and fission) the principle of LCE applies. When atoms lose some of their original mass (mass defect) due to the LCE the lost mass is converted to energy (E = mc<sup>2</sup>). The energy released per nucleon is greater during fusion reactions.

Trends from a BE graph are:



*   Binding energy of nucleon increase as the smaller nuclei fuse together, this is the energy released during fusion
*   Elements w/ A = 40-80 have the most stable nuclei, they have the highest binding energy per nucleon and take more energy to break nuclei apart.
*   Fission is everything after iron
*   Larger nuclei (greater than iron) have a lower binding energy per nucleon $\rightarrow$ relatively lower stability
*
*   Iron (56) has the most stable nucleus. Nuclei smaller than iron undergo fusion and release energy. Nuclei larger than iron undergo fission and release energy.


## Deep Inside the Atom

Are Protons and Neutrons Fundamental Particles?

Fundamental particles are elementary, indivisible particles

The model of the atom that we use today has a nucleus positive protons and neutral neutrons surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. A fourth particle, the photon has no mass and no charge but has quantised energy and momentum. The electron and photon appear to be fundamental particles.

Experimental evidence suggests the neutron has its own magnetic field indicating the neutron has internal structure and contains charges that cancel out (0 net charge) Therefore the neutron is not a fundamental particle.

Evidence of radioactivity (positron emission/beta+) a proton transmutes into a neutron with the emission of a positron and a neutrino suggested that the neutron and proton are not fundamental.

Cosmic ray experiments led to discovery of new particles of muons and mesons.

Cloud chamber experiments with cosmic rays allows for detection of positrons and ionising radiation (alpha beta).

8.5.2 Standard Model of Matter

Matter – molecule $\rightarrow$ atom

Proton and neutrons $\rightarrow$ quarks

The atom consists of neutrons, electrons and protons. Particle accelerators and nuclear reactors have revealed other subatomic particles such as quarks, neutrino (v), anti-neutrino, positron. The standard model attempts to describe all interactions of subatomic particles and places matter into groups. All particles have antiparticles (opposite charge, identical otherwise)

**Formula of proton: **

UUD = + 2/3 e + 2/3 e - 1/3 e = +1e

**Formula of neutron:**

UDD = +2/3 e - 1/3 e – 1/3 e = 0 = neutral charge

4 fundamental forces in the universe which act by exchanging force particles (boson): weakest to strongest – gravity [acts through graviton exchange particle (not yet discovered)], electromagnetic force [acts through photons], weak nuclear force [acts through z and w bosons], strong nuclear force [through gluons (show using squiggly lines)]

**Discovery of the Higgs Boson**

Peter Higgs predicted the Higgs Boson in 1964 which was detected using ATLAS at CERN in the large hadron collider in 2012 (Nobel prize 2013). This confirms the standard model. Bosons are force mediating particles or exchange particles

Boson force exchange particles

As electron A approaches electron B, each electron emits a photon that is absorbed by the other leading to an experience of a force of repulsion or attraction, photon is responsible for this.

Force particles cause attraction forces between matter by being exchanged in such a way that the matter particles are pushed towards each other. Repulsion forces occur by having force particles exchanged in such a way that the matter particles are pushed away from each other.

Weak nuclear forces are responsible for nuclear decay (alpha and beta) and contributes minuscule to keeping atom together * allows for particle to be emitted



*   Gravity - graviton
*   Electromagnetism – photon
    *   Range of effect is infinite since it has no rest mass
    *   Experienced by everything with charge (quarks, leptons, 𝑊±)
    *   Holds atoms and molecules together through the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, and the attraction between atoms in a molecule
*   Strong nuclear force - gluon
    *   Responsible for keeping the nucleus stable and together
    *   Diminishes with increasing separation and is negligible for separations greater than about 10<sup>-14</sup>m.
    *   Gluons can only have an effect over a very short range.
*   Weak nuclear force – Z W boson
    *   Experience by quarks and leptons
    *   Responsible for nuclear radiation and fission
    *   Only force that can change the flavour (type) of a quark or lepton. It allows quarks and leptons
    *   The weak force is the only force that can change the charge of a particle, because 𝑊+, 𝑊−are the only charged force carriers.
    *   The most common example of a weak interaction is beta decay. Beta-minus decay is due to the weak force turning a down quark into an up quark, hence a neutron into a proton.

First generation particles form matter. Second generation particles are less stable and decay to form 1<sup>st</sup> generation particles. 3<sup>rd</sup> generation particles are even more unstable and decay to form 2<sup>nd</sup> generation. 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation particles cannot make up matter and are harder to detect. As generation increases, mass of particle also increases.

Is the standard model complete?

Has been effective in predicting experimental results eg: gluon, Higgs Boson, W and Z Bosons, 6 quarks have all been experimentally confirmed. However, the standard model is still incomplete because it claims neutrinos have 0 mass, does not include the gravitational force (graviton), dark matter or dark energy. Testing the limits of the standard model experimentally are areas of ongoing research at LHC. Physicists hope to develop the grand unified theory that would incorporate dark matter and energy.

**Particle Accelerators**

Most of standard model was verified using particle accelerators.



1. Particles are accelerated to near the speed of light, giving them much higher energy than they would ordinarily have.
2. The high-energy particles are made to collide
3. The kinetic energy is converted to rest mass, creating new particles that can be studied

With more powerful particle-accelerators that can produce particle collisions $\rightarrow$ increase in subatomic particles discovered eg: Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Particle accelerators give protons, electrons or ions (charged particles) (must have a charge) enough energy to smash into one another.

Examples of particle accelerators:

1930s Van de Graaf Generator – Devised a continuous high voltage supply that could be used to accelerate and ions to energies of 0.5MeV (can’t measure speed very well so use energy to represent speed).

1960s Linear accelerators – Eg: Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC) where charged particles are passed through a 3km evacuated tube, electrons accelerator accelerated to 50GeV (very close to c). Pioneered the discovery of protons as non-fundamental particles through deep inelastic scattering:



*   Electrons and protons are fired at each other at high speed
*   At lower energies, the electron and proton elastically scatter
*   At high energies, the proton absorbs some energy from the electron which makes the collision inelastic. The proton is then able to emit a quark.
*   Scattered if as they were 3 dense positive charges in a proton. It was not like billiard
*   balls
*   If the proton is able to absorb energy and emit a particle, it cannot be a fundamental particle

Cyclotrons – charged particles move through semi-circular arcs. As their velocity increases, so does the radius of the arc DON’T PICTURE A SPIRAL, MORE LIKE ELCTRON SHELLS. Towards the outside of the last arc, the particle is deflected towards the target. All charged particles.

*   A small tube leads a stream of hydrogen gas to the centre of the box where a spark strips away the electron from each atom.
*   An alternating electric field between the gap accelerates the proton when passing across the gap.
*   The magnetic field steers the proton into a circular trajectory. The magnetic field direction is perpendicular to the plane of the circle.
*   As the protons accelerate in a circular trajectory, they pass cross the gap between the two copper ‘D’s.
*   As the protons gain energy, the radius of their orbit increases and they gradually spiral out to the limit of the magnetic pole’s area. Air is removed from the entire region so that collisions with air molecules do not interfere with the accelerator.

Betatron – accelerates electrons but in system like Cyclotron

Synchrotron – main accelerators in contemporary use eg: LHC. Still uses a circular path but the particles are kept in a constant radius by using super conducting magnets thus, shape is a ring rather than a disk. The Magnetic field can be concentrated on portions of the particle rather than full area.

In a synchrotron, the path travelled is a circle, however the frequency of the electric field and strength of the magnetic field has to change depending on the velocity of the particle.



*   The electric and magnetic fields have to be synchronised to the position and velocity of the particles

The Large Hadron Collider is an enormous collider. It uses a linear accelerator to initially accelerate the particles, then a series of synchrotrons to accelerate the particles in stages.

It was built after previous results from accelerators hinted at the existence of the Higgs boson, the particle that is hypothesized to give particles their mass. In 2012, the LHC detected a particle that behaved like a Higgs boson.

Explain: role of particle accelerators in obtaining evidence that tests or validates the Standard Model and other theories.

Particle accelerators assist in probing and investigating the structure of matter by:

High energy $\rightarrow$ high speed $\rightarrow$ λ = h/mv $\rightarrow$ wavelength reduces as v increases $\rightarrow$ smaller wavelengths results in higher resolution allowing very small particles to be detected

High energy $\rightarrow$ higher mass/momentum $\rightarrow$ can be detected as it is larger Pv = m0v/√1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>

A vast majority of particles can only be observed in high energy particle accelerators, at lower energies these particles are not visible


## 	 \
Working Scientifically:

**Reliability**



*   Reliability is the extent of which an experiment yields consistent results
*   To allow a person to determine the reliability of an experiment’s results, the experiment must be repeated 3+ times
*   Presence of random errors in the experiment reduce reliability but, systematic errors have no impact
*   A set of results can be inaccurate but, reliable

An experiment is reliable if repetitio of the experiment yields the same results. A measurement is reliable is when repeated there is a similar result.

Reducing impact of random errors on the method improves reliability. Removing outliers, repeating the experiment and averaging results help yield improved reliability.

**Validity**



*   Does the experiment test the hypothesis I want? Have all variables been kept constant besides the independent and dependent variable?
*   Extent of which the experiment tests the hypothesis and addresses experimental aim (control variables adequately controlled, only one IV and DV).
*   Dependent on suitability of experimental design and presence of systematic errors.
*   Method must satisfy all assumptions.

**Accuracy**

Extent of which experimental results match with the true and accepted value. Can be increased through reduction of systematic errors. Can be tested by comparing experimental value to accepted value.

The accuracy of a measurement is a way of talking about the total error in your final result. An accurate measurement is very close to the true value. Just because a measurement is accurate doesn’t mean it is precise; an accurate value with a wide possible range isn’t very useful.

**Percent error: **(accepted value-experimental value/accepted value) x 100

**Error: (referring to degree of accuracy)**



*   **Systematic**

    Biases measurements in some predictable way, although you may not know how to predict it. It either increases or decreases the measurement consistently. A simple example would be a voltmeter that only displays 90% of the true voltage, so the size of the error changes depending on what you’re measuring. No impact on reliability.

*   **Random**

    A random error is an error that is present every time you take the measurement, but which varies unpredictably in size and direction. Random errors are always present. The effects of random errors can be reduced only by repeating the measurement many times.

*   **Illegitimate**

    An illegitimate error is a one-time mistake in the procedure that produces a bizarre value. If you know you made a mistake then you can just throw out that measurement. Usually the mistake is more subtle, for example misreading a display or an unexpected power surge in the equipment. In this case some statistical criteria is used to throw out data that


    are well outside the normal range of possibility (outlier).


**Uncertainty (refer to degree of precision and accuracy)**

**Absolute uncertainty: **0.5 x limit of reading for analogous scales and limit of reading for digital scales, or largest deviation from mean

**Relative Uncertainty:** expresses relative size of uncertainty of measurement. (Absolute uncertainty/value) x 100

When multiple readings are taken to reduce the effect of random error, the uncertainty is determined by finding the average value and then comparing the average to the readings. The greatest variation within the readings from the average becomes the uncertainty (unless this is less than the uncertainty of the readings themselves). This can be expressed as an absolute error or relative error.

Significant figures are sometimes used as an implicit way of indicating uncertainty. When this occurs, the last digit is considered uncertain. For example, a result reported as 1.23 implies a minimum uncertainty of ±0.01 and a range of 1.22 to 1.24.

**Uncertainty in the measurand (dependant variable): **

Range is (maximum – minimum value)

Value of measurand = average value of multiple measurements or minimum value + 0.5 range

Uncertainty in this is 0.5 range = 0.5(max – min)

Uncertainty should only be reported to one or two significant figures.

Uncertainty of the average:



1. Find range of values (max – min)
2. Divide range by 2, this is the uncertainty.
3. Uncertainty of the average is R/2√N, where R is range and N is number of values

**Precision:** expresses amount of confidence in the reproducibility of measurements (reliability?). More decimal places on measurement tool indicates higher precision. The precision of a measurement is the total amount of random error present. A very precise measurement has small random errors i.e. a small spread of results, but just because a measurement is precise doesn’t mean that it is accurate (see below); undiscovered systematic errors might skew your results drastically. The precision of the final result of an experiment cannot be better than the precision of the measurements made during the experiment, so the aim of the experimenter should be to make the estimates as good as possible. Repeatability of measurement of a value.

**Uncertainty Calculation Rules:**



1. If a measured quantity is multiplied/divided by constant then the absolute uncertainty is divided/multiplied by same constant (relative stays the same)
2. If 2 measured quantities are added or subtracted then absolute uncertainties are added
3. If more than two measured quantities are multiplied/divided then relative uncertainties are added
4. If quantity is raised to a power then relative uncertainty is multiplied by the power

**Rounding:**

When the digit to be dropped is less than five, write the number without the last digit. e.g. 105.874 becomes 105.87

When the digit to be dropped is greater than five, the preceding digit is increased by one. e.g. 105.876 becomes 105.88

When the digit to be dropped is exactly five, then the nearest even number is used for the preceding digit. e.g. 105.885 becomes 105.88 and 105.875 becomes 105.88

For addition and subtraction written answer should have the least number of places in the decimal portion of the number in the problem.

For multiplication and division the number of significant digits in the answer is same number of significant figures as the number with the fewest significant figures in the data used in the calculation.

156000 is ambiguous, take the conservative road of 3 significant figures

Rules:



5. If a measured quantity is multiplied/divided by constant then absolute uncertainty is divided/multiplied by same constant
6. If 2 measured quantities are added or subtracted then absolute uncertainties are added
7. If over two measured quantities are multiplied/divided then relative uncertainties are added
8. If quantity is raised to a power then relative uncertainty is multiplied by the power?
