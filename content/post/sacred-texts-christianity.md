## Books of the Bible
- The Bible can be broken down into 2 parts:
  - Old Testament: Hebrew Bible consisting of the 24 books of the TaNaKh (can be divided into Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim)
    - Also contains the Apocrypha/Deuterocanon, which are disputed books (Catholics and Orthodox recognise these books as part of the Bible, Protestants do not)
  - New Testament: 27 books about the life and actions of Jesus, consists of 4 Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), followed by the Acts of the Apostles, then the 21 Epistles (Letters) and the Book of Revelation.
- Note: Jesus did not exist in the Old Testament because he was NOT BORN YET!!!
