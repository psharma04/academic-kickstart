## Definition
- A function is a relation between two sets of data where each input has 1 or less potential outputs
- Horizontal Lines, Parabolas, Linear Equations, Hyperbolas, Exponentials, Polynomials and Cubic Graphs are all examples of functions
- Circles and Vertical Lines are NOT functions
- In other words, functions can be one-to-one or many-to-one relationships, but not one-to-many relationships (In reference to input and output values)
## Notation
- There are 3 methods of expressing functions:
  - \\(y=123\\)
  - \\(f(x)=123\\)
  - \\(f:x→123\\)
- All of the above methods say the same thing:
  - When \\(x\\) is the input, \\(123\\) is the output
- For example:
  - \\(y=2x\\)
  - \\(f(x)=2x\\)
  - \\(f:x→2x\\)
- All state that when \\(x\\) is the input, \\(2x\\) is the output
## Vertical Line Test
- The vertical line test is a quick way to test if a graph is a function
- If a vertical line can cut the function TWICE OR MORE, the graph is not a function
- In the graph below, the red graph is a function, but the blue line is not, because the green vertical line cuts the blue line at 2 points

## Set Notation
- In set notation, different types of brackets have different meanings:
  - "(" and ")" are used to write a set where the boundaries are **EXCLUDED**
  - "[" and "]" are used to write a set where the boundaries are **INCLUDED**
- \\(\infty\\) means Infinity while \\(- \infty\\) means Negative Infinity
- \\(x\in[1,\infty)\\) means that "\\(x\\) is in the set of all numbers between 1 and infinity"

## Domain And Range
- All functions have a Domain and Range
  - The domain of a function is all the valid input values
  - The range of a function is all the valid output values
- Some input values are INVALID and therefore not part of the Domain
  - For Example:
    - In \\(g(x)=\sqrt{x}\\), only positive values of \\(x\\) are possible (because negative numbers have no graphable roots)
    - Therefore, \\(x\\) must be greater than or equal to zero (0)
    - This can be expressed as \\(x \geq 0\\) OR \\(x\in(0,\infty)\\)
- Some output values are INVALID and therefore not part of the Range
  - y-asymptotes are not part of the range
  - All y values above/below the minimum/maximum y of a graph are not part of the range
## Transformations of a Function (from \\(f(x)\\))
- Vertical Translation Up \\(c\\) units: \\(f(x)+c\\)
- Vertical Translation Down \\(c\\) units: \\(f(x)-c\\)
- Horizontal Translation Left \\(c\\) units: \\(f(x+c)\\)
- Horizontal Translation Right \\(c\\) units: \\(f(x-c)\\)

## Odd and Even functions
- Even Functions:
  - Symmetrical about the y-axis
  - Rules:
    - \\(f(-x)=f(x)\\)
    - If \\((x,y)\\) is a valid solution to \\(f(x)\\), \\((x,-y)\\) is in the same function
- Odd Functions:
  - Symmetrical about the origin \\((0,0)\\)
  - Rules:
    - \\(f(-x)=-f(x)\\)
    - If \\((x,y)\\) is a valid solution to \\(f(x)\\), then \\((-x,-y)\\) is also a valid solution
- Proving/Solving Odd and Even Functions:
  1. Find \\(f(-x)\\)
  2. Simplify \\(f(-x)\\)
  3. If \\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\), the function is ODD
  4. If \\(f(-x) = f(x)\\), the function is EVEN
  5. If \\(f(-x) \neq f(x)\\) AND \\(f(-x) \neq -f(x)\\), the function is NEITHER ODD NOR EVEN
