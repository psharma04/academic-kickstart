## Separation from the Land
*  For Aboriginal people, loss of Land is the same as loss of spiritual identity
   *  Results in inability to fulfill ritual responsibilities, and a loss of purpose
*  Land is inextricably connected to kinship, ceremonial life, family connections and relationships
*  Loss of land resulted in the destruction of totemic responsibilities

### Order of events
*  1788: settlement and establishment of Terra Nullius, marked the start of the removal of tribes from the Land
*  1820s-1850s: government and churches established missions and reserves
 *  Imposed Chrisitianity and European culture/lifestyle
 *  Objected to most aspects of Aboriginal spirituality

## Separation from Kinship Groups
* Destroyed kinship and the identity of Aboriginal communities
* Wiped out thousands of years of stories and culture, which is irretrievable without those kinship ties

### Order of events
* 1838: Policy of Protection forcibly placed Aboriginal people on missions and reserves, which resulted in the mass dispossession of Aboriginal people
  *  Deliberate attempt to destroy Aboriginal spirituality
  *  Resulted in the destruction of kinship, traditional gender roles, culture, language, etc.
* 1901: Policy of Assimilation removed mixed Aboriginal people from kinship groups
  * Assimilated mixed children were not permitted to visit Aboriginal relatives, which was detrimental to the all-encompassing nature of Aboriginal spirituality

## Stolen Generations
* From the late 1800s to the 1970s, forced separation of Aboriginal children from their families was Government policy
* As many as 100000 children were removed in a deliberate attempt to remove their Aboriginal identity and deteriorate the Aboriginal culture
*  Bringing Them Home Report:
 *  Revealed the loss of Heritage, Culture, Language, Land and Community
 *  Made 54 recommendations to the government, e.g. 7a, which recommended for a National Sorry Day to be held annually
* Life expectancy: Aboriginal life expectancy is 20 years below the Australian average
 *  Indicative of a poor, subordinate class in Australian society
 *  Caused by the loss of land and disconnection with family and kinship groups
