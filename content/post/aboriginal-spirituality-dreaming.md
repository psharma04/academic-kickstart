-   The Dreaming is a fundamental concept that underpins all aspects of
    Aboriginal spirituality
-   The Dreaming refers to Aboriginal spiritual beliefs about creation and
    existence
-   According to Aboriginal spirituality, all life is part of a larger network
    that can be traced back to the ANCESTOR BEINGS of the Dreaming
-   The Dreaming involves all knowledge and understanding in Aboriginal
    societies
-   The Dreaming incorporates an explanation for the origins of the Universe
-   *The Dreaming is INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE LAND* as the Land is the
    physical medium through which the Dreaming is expressed, and since the
    Ancestor Spirits are said to continue to reside within the Land
-   The Dreaming is METATEMPORAL, meaning it incorporates the past, present and
    future as a complete and present reality
-   The Dreaming is embedded in all aspects of Aboriginal life, because every
    part of Aboriginal life is derived from the Dreaming
### Kinship
-   Kinship identify a system of belonging and responsibilities within a clan
-   Kinship is not only based on family, but also one’s totem, usually a plant
    or an animal, which represent a person’s or group’s connection with the
    Ancestor Spirits
-   Kinship ties govern all interactions with other people (such as who you can
    marry, who you can talk to, etc.), as well as responsibilities (such as
    educating younger generations, etc.)
### Art
-   Art is a very important method of communicating the Dreaming because it
    illustrates the actions of the Ancestor Spirits in the Land
-   Aboriginal art has multiple layers of meaning:
    -   At face value, they are merely a depiction of the land, similar to a map
        or cartography chart
    -   At a deeper level, they portray the actions of the Ancestor Spirits
    -   To the initiated, more subtle, profound meanings are visible, further
        educating them on the actions of the Ancestor Spirits
### Stories
-   Stories from the Dreaming describe Aboriginal Law and Lifestyle
-   The Dreaming is often described through stories which dictate the Ancestor
    Spirits moved through the land, creating features that are visible today
-   These stories provide a foundation and explanation of various aspects of
    Aboriginal tradition and law by explaining the creation of the Natural World
    and how the Dreaming shapes the day-to-day life of people and animals
-   Learning the Dreaming stories is a lifelong process, and is important for
    teaching Aboriginal people the moral conduct of their people and of society
### Rituals
-   Rituals from the Dreaming relive the actions of the Ancestor Spirits
-   Derived from important aspects of the Dreaming
-   Important because they are understood as reliving an event in the present
    moment
-   Ancestor Beings are “made present” through the people, objects, words, and
    movements used during the ritual
    -   Example: The Smoking Ceremony, in which smoke is used to cleanse and
        heal. The ritual is performed symbolically at public events, but also
        during other traditional uses such as smoking ceremonies
-   Totems carry ceremonial responsibilities known as balance rites
    -   Aim to assist the proliferation (growth, spread or increase) of a
        particular species, which embody an individual’s ancestor spirit as they
        existed during the Dreaming
    -   For example, if a particular tribe was part human and part echidna in
        the Dreaming, that tribe would have ritual responsibilities towards
        echidnas
### Obligations to the Land and People
-   The Land is of Paramount importance in Aboriginal spirituality
-   Aboriginal people regard the Land as their mother and have worked to deepen
    their understanding and appreciation of the Land
-   *THE LAND IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE DREAMING*
    -   The Land is the physical medium through which the Dreaming is expressed
-   The Land provides the foundation for Aboriginal beliefs, traditions, rituals
    and laws because the stories of the Dreaming are embedded in the land
-   The Land is the dwelling of the Ancestor Beings, and is regarded as the
    mother of all people
    -   The identity of the individual is inextricably linked to the Land
    -   Quote: “I belong to the Land, and the Land belongs to me” – Patrick
        Dodson, 1976
-   Aboriginal people are the caretakers, owners, inhabitants and custodians of
    the Land
    -   This is the origin of the Acknowledgement of Country used at formal
        events in Australia
-   Aboriginal people have ritual responsibilities based on their totem
