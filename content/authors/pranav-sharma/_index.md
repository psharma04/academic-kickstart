I'm a year 11 student at St Marks Catholic College. I specialise in theoretical sciences and mathematics, as well as full-stack software and hardware development. I am currently employed as a Network Administrator at Sydney Water, and do graphics design under the [Heimdall Studios](https://heimdall.intranet.pw) banner. My latest project was a website analyzing the [Stuxnet Malware](https://stuxnet.intranet.pw).
